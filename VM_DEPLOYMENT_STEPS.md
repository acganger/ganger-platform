# ðŸš€ EOS L10 VM Deployment Steps

Since you have SSH access to your VM, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Upload Files (From Your Local Terminal)

```bash
# From the ganger-platform directory, upload the deployment package
scp eos-l10-vm-deploy.tar.gz anand@35.225.189.208:~/

# Also upload the deployment script
scp deploy-on-vm-direct.sh anand@35.225.189.208:~/
```

## Step 2: SSH to Your VM

```bash
ssh anand@35.225.189.208
```

## Step 3: Run the Deployment Script (On the VM)

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x deploy-on-vm-direct.sh

# Run the deployment
./deploy-on-vm-direct.sh
```

## What the Script Will Do

1. âœ… Check for the deployment package
2. âœ… Install Node.js 20 (if needed)
3. âœ… Install PM2 globally (if needed)
4. âœ… Extract the application to `~/ganger-apps/eos-l10`
5. âœ… Install npm dependencies
6. âœ… Build the Next.js application
7. âœ… Start the app with PM2
8. âœ… Configure auto-restart on reboot
9. âœ… Clean up temporary files

## After Deployment

Your app will be accessible at:
- **Direct**: http://35.225.189.208:3010
- **Via Staff Portal**: https://staff.gangerdermatology.com/l10 (Worker already configured!)

## Useful Commands on the VM

```bash
# Check app status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs eos-l10

# Restart app
pm2 restart eos-l10

# Monitor performance
pm2 monit

# Test locally
curl http://localhost:3010
```

## Files You Need

Both files are in the current directory:
- `eos-l10-vm-deploy.tar.gz` - The application package (4.4MB)
- `deploy-on-vm-direct.sh` - The deployment script
