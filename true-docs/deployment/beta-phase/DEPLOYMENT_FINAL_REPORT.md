## ❌ Still Building or Failed (7)

1. Batch Closeout
2. EOS L10
3. Handouts
4. Integration Status
5. Pharma Scheduling
6. Socials & Reviews
7. Staff Portal

## Key Issues Resolved

1. **Removed root vercel.json** that was causing schema validation errors
2. **Disabled pnpm** by removing packageManager field and .npmrc
3. **Converted workspace:* dependencies to file: paths** for npm compatibility
4. **Set explicit npm commands** for all projects
5. **Added ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COREPACK=0** environment variable

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor remaining deployments** - Several apps are still building
2. **Fix failed deployments** - Debug specific errors for the 7 failed apps
3. **Update staff portal rewrites** - Configure vercel.json to route to deployed apps
4. **Set up custom domains** - Configure proper URLs for production use
5. **Run verification tests** - Ensure all deployed apps are functioning correctly

## Deployment Architecture

Each app is deployed as an independent Vercel project with:
- GitHub integration for automatic deployments
- Individual environment variables
- Monorepo-aware build configuration
- npm as the package manager

## Access Pattern

Currently, each app has its own Vercel URL. The next step is to configure the staff portal router to provide a unified access point at `staff.gangerdermatology.com`.

**Note**: This deployment used the "Distributed Deployment Architecture" as recommended by the deployment engineer, with each app as a separate Vercel project rather than a single monolithic deployment.
