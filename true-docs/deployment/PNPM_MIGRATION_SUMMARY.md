# PNPM Migration Summary

## What We Did

### 1. Migrated from npm to pnpm
- Created `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to define monorepo structure
- Updated root `package.json` to use `"packageManager": "pnpm@8.15.0"`
- Generated `pnpm-lock.yaml` by running `pnpm install`
- Added pnpm overrides for React version consistency

### 2. Fixed DevDependencies Issue
- Added `NODE_ENV=development` to install commands
- This ensures TypeScript and other devDependencies are installed during Vercel builds
- Without this, pnpm skips devDependencies in production mode

### 3. Created vercel.json for All Failed Apps
Created vercel.json files with proper pnpm commands for:
- eos-l10
- batch-closeout  
- ai-receptionist
- call-center-ops
- checkin-kiosk
- clinical-staffing
- compliance-training
- config-dashboard
- pharma-scheduling
- socials-reviews

Each vercel.json contains:
```json
{
  "installCommand": "cd ../.. && NODE_ENV=development pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile",
  "buildCommand": "cd ../.. && pnpm -F @ganger/[app-name] build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "framework": "nextjs"
}
```

### 4. Set Environment Variables
- Set `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COREPACK=1` for all 10 projects
- This enables Vercel to use the pnpm version specified in package.json

## Why This Works

1. **pnpm supports workspace:* protocol** - npm@10.2.4 doesn't, but pnpm does natively
2. **Corepack ensures correct pnpm version** - Vercel uses the exact version we specify
3. **NODE_ENV=development** - Forces installation of all dependencies, not just production
4. **--no-frozen-lockfile** - Allows pnpm to update lockfile if needed during build

## Current Status

- All 10 failed apps now have proper pnpm configuration
- Deployments have been triggered by the git push
- Environment variables are set for Corepack support
- Build process should now:
  1. Detect pnpm from packageManager field
  2. Use Corepack to install pnpm@8.15.0
  3. Run pnpm install with devDependencies
  4. Build each app successfully

## Next Steps

1. Monitor Vercel dashboard for build status
2. Check build logs to confirm pnpm is being used
3. Once builds succeed, verify apps are accessible
4. Update staff portal's vercel.json rewrites with new deployment URLs

## If Issues Persist

The deployment engineer provided Option B as fallback:
- Recreate projects through Vercel UI (not API)
- This ensures proper GitHub integration
- Would need to be done for each of the 10 apps

But based on the logs showing pnpm working correctly, Option A (pnpm migration) should succeed.
