# Correct Deployment Approach - Based on Engineer Feedback

**Date**: June 27, 2025

## Key Insights from Deployment Engineer

### 1. No "Deployment Helper" App
- The deployment-helper app should NOT exist
- @ganger/* packages are workspace packages, not deployable apps
- They get bundled INTO each app during local build

### 2. How Working Apps Deploy
- Each app runs `pnpm install` locally to resolve workspace dependencies
- `pnpm build` bundles everything including @ganger/* packages
- The output in `.next/` is self-contained
- Vercel deploys this pre-bundled, self-contained app

### 3. Why EOS L10 Failed
- It's trying to resolve @ganger/* packages on Vercel
- Vercel can't handle `file:../../packages/*` references
- The app needs to be built locally first

## Correct Process for Deploying Apps

### Option 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)
1. Ensure app builds locally with all dependencies
2. Push to main branch
3. Vercel automatically deploys the pre-built app

### Option 2: CLI Deployment
1. Navigate to app directory: `cd apps/eos-l10`
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Build locally: `pnpm build`
4. Deploy: `vercel --prod`

### Or Use the Automation Script:
```bash
./scripts/01-deploy-all-apps.sh
# Or for specific app:
APPS="eos-l10" ./scripts/01-deploy-all-apps.sh
```

## Action Items

### 1. Remove deployment-helper
This app was created by mistake and should be deleted:
- Delete `/apps/deployment-helper/` directory
- Remove from Vercel projects

### 2. Fix .npmrc Configuration
Per the documentation, add `.npmrc` with:
```
node-linker=hoisted
public-hoist-pattern[]=*
shamefully-hoist=true
```

### 3. Deploy Apps Correctly
Use the existing scripts or ensure local build before deployment

## Summary

The fundamental misunderstanding was thinking we needed a special app to "cache" packages. In reality:
- Each app is self-contained after local build
- Workspace packages are bundled during build
- Vercel just deploys the final output
