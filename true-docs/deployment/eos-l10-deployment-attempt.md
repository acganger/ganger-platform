# EOS L10 Deployment Attempt - Lessons Learned

**Date**: June 27, 2025  
**App**: EOS L10 Team Management

## Deployment Attempt Summary

### Issue Encountered
The EOS L10 app failed to deploy due to monorepo workspace dependencies. The build failed with:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@ganger/ui'
Module not found: Can't resolve '@ganger/auth'
```

### Root Cause
Unlike the deployment-helper app (which had no real code dependencies), the EOS L10 app has actual code imports from the workspace packages:
- `@ganger/auth`
- `@ganger/ui`
- `@ganger/db`
- `@ganger/utils`
- `@ganger/types`
- `@ganger/integrations`

### Key Learning
The successful deployments (Inventory, Handouts, etc.) are still using `file:` references to workspace packages, suggesting they're using a different deployment approach that properly handles the monorepo structure.

## Deployment Strategies for Monorepo Apps

### Option 1: Monorepo-Aware Deployment (Current for successful apps)
- Keep the `file:` references
- Use proper Vercel monorepo configuration
- Deploy from repository root with workspace commands

### Option 2: Self-Contained Apps (Used for deployment-helper)
- Remove all workspace dependencies
- Make the app completely standalone
- Only works for simple apps without shared code

### Option 3: Package Publishing
- Publish @ganger/* packages to npm registry
- Update all apps to use published versions
- Requires package versioning and release management

### Option 4: Bundle Dependencies
- Copy workspace package code into each app during build
- Use build tools to inline the dependencies
- Increases app size but simplifies deployment

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Successful Deployments**: Study how Inventory, Handouts, and other successfully deployed apps handle workspace dependencies

2. **Check Vercel Project Settings**: The successfully deployed apps might have special Vercel project configurations

3. **Consider Deployment Strategy**: Decide whether to:
   - Fix the monorepo deployment configuration
   - Or refactor apps to be self-contained
   - Or implement a build process that bundles dependencies

## Recommendation

For now, focus on deploying simpler apps or investigating how the already-deployed apps are configured in Vercel. The deployment-helper success proves the basic deployment pipeline works - the challenge is handling the monorepo dependencies.
