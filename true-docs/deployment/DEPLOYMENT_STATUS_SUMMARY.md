### ❌ Pending Deployment (9/17 apps)

#### Staff Portal (CRITICAL)
- **Status**: Project exists but deployments fail
- **Issue**: GitHub integration appears disconnected
- **Latest Error**: Build failures even after dependency fixes
- **Impact**: Beta testers cannot access the platform

#### Phase 2 Apps (Ready to Deploy)
- **EOS L10** - Team management (high priority)
- **Batch Closeout** - Financial operations (critical)

#### Remaining Apps
- Integration Status
- Pharma Scheduling
- Socials & Reviews
- AI Receptionist
- Call Center Operations
- Medication Authorization
- Component Showcase

## Root Causes Identified

1. **GitHub Integration Disconnected**
   - API returns "The provided GitHub repository can't be found"
   - Affects all automated deployments

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Fixed: Added @tailwindcss/postcss, autoprefixer, postcss
   - Staff app now builds locally

3. **Vercel Token Limitations**
   - Deploy hooks API not working
   - May need elevated permissions

## Immediate Actions Required

### Option 1: Manual Vercel Dashboard (FASTEST - 10 minutes)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/ganger/ganger-staff
2. Click Settings → Git
3. Reconnect GitHub repository
4. Click "Redeploy" on latest commit

### Option 2: Vercel CLI Deployment (RELIABLE - 15 minutes)

## For Beta Testing Timeline

### Today (Immediate)
1. Deploy staff portal using one of the options above
2. Share https://staff.gangerdermatology.com with beta testers
3. They can access 7 working apps + coming soon pages
