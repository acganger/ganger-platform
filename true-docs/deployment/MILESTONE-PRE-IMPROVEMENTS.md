**Date**: August 2, 2025  
**Git Tag**: `v2.0.0-pre-improvements`  
**Commit**: `3d8fc6b1`

## Current State

This milestone captures the platform state before implementing the comprehensive improvement plan. All applications are currently building and deployed successfully.

### Platform Status
- **Total Apps**: 21 (all operational)
- **Build Status**: ✅ All apps building successfully
- **Deployment**: ✅ All apps deployed on Vercel
- **Test Coverage**: ~20%
- **Bundle Sizes**: 150-400KB per app
- **Error Rate**: ~0.5%

### Recent Fixes Applied
1. **Redis Connection Issues**: Resolved with lazy initialization
2. **UI-Catalyst Package**: Fixed exports and TypeScript errors
3. **Force-Dynamic API Routes**: Applied to prevent static generation
4. **Monitoring Package**: Dist files committed for Vercel builds
5. **TypeScript Build Hangs**: Workaround applied (ignoreBuildErrors)

### Known Issues (Pre-Improvement)
- Low test coverage (<20%)
- Security vulnerabilities (rate limiting, CSRF)
- Performance bottlenecks (heavy shared dependencies)
- Incomplete features (purchase orders, stock counting)
- Technical debt (TypeScript workarounds)

## Rollback Instructions

If any improvements cause critical issues, rollback to this stable version:

```bash
# Rollback locally
git checkout v2.0.0-pre-improvements

# Force push to revert remote (use with caution)
git push --force origin v2.0.0-pre-improvements:main

# Or create a revert branch
git checkout -b revert-to-stable v2.0.0-pre-improvements
git push origin revert-to-stable
```

## Deployment Verification

After rollback, verify all apps are building:
```bash
pnpm run build:changed
pnpm run verify:changed
```
