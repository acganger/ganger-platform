# Current Deployment Status - Ganger Platform

**Last Updated**: June 27, 2025  
**Deployment Method**: Vercel Distributed Architecture  
**Status**: 8/17 Apps Successfully Deployed and Accessible

## Overview

The Ganger Platform is deployed using Vercel's distributed deployment architecture, where each application is deployed as an independent Vercel project. This approach provides better isolation, scaling, and deployment management.

## ✅ Successfully Deployed Applications (8)

## 🎉 Recent Deployment Success - Deployment Helper

**Date**: June 27, 2025  
**App**: Deployment Helper  
**Status**: Successfully deployed to production  
**URL**: https://deployment-helper-kappa.vercel.app  

### Issues Resolved:
1. **Monorepo Path Issues**: Removed file: references to workspace packages
2. **TypeScript Config**: Made tsconfig.json self-contained instead of extending workspace config
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Added tailwindcss, postcss, and autoprefixer to devDependencies
4. **Build Configuration**: Simplified vercel.json to use standard Next.js build commands

### Deployment Helper Purpose:
- Validates that the Vercel deployment environment is properly configured
- Serves as a simple app to test deployment pipeline
- Provides a status page confirming successful deployment

## ⚠️ Deployment Challenge Discovered - EOS L10

**Date**: June 27, 2025  
**Issue**: Apps with workspace dependencies require different deployment approach

### Key Finding:
- Simple apps (like deployment-helper) can be made self-contained
- Apps using shared packages (@ganger/*) need proper monorepo deployment configuration
- The 7 successfully deployed apps are using a different deployment strategy that handles workspace dependencies

### Next Steps:
1. Investigate how the successfully deployed apps (Inventory, Handouts, etc.) are configured
2. Check their Vercel project settings for monorepo configuration
3. Apply the same configuration to undeployed apps

## Key Configuration Changes Made

### 1. Package Manager
- Disabled pnpm by removing `packageManager` field from root package.json
- Removed `.npmrc` file configured for pnpm
- Set `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COREPACK=0` environment variable on all projects
- Configured explicit npm commands for builds

### 2. Dependency Management
- Converted `workspace:*` dependencies to `file:` paths
- This allows npm to properly resolve monorepo dependencies

### 3. Build Configuration
Each project is configured with:
```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "installCommand": "npm install --force",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "rootDirectory": "apps/[app-name]",
  "nodeVersion": "20.x"
}
```

### 4. Environment Variables
All projects have been configured with required environment variables from the `.env` file.

## 🚨 Critical Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Staff Portal (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
The staff.gangerdermatology.com domain is configured but returns 404 because the staff app isn't deployed:
- Create Vercel project for `ganger-staff`
- Configure environment variables
- Connect domain in Vercel dashboard
- Deploy the app

### 2. Fix Projects with DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND
These 6 apps have Vercel projects but failed to deploy:
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- The workspace:* dependencies have been fixed (commit b9733b35)
- Trigger new deployments or redeploy from dashboard

### 3. Create Missing Vercel Projects
4 apps need Vercel projects created:
- Import from GitHub: acganger/ganger-platform
- Set root directory to apps/[app-name]
- Configure build commands as per vercel.json

### 4. Update Staff Portal Rewrites
Once other apps are deployed, update the destination URLs in staff/vercel.json to use the actual deployment URLs instead of placeholder URLs

## Deployment Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     staff.gangerdermatology.com         │
│         (Staff Portal Router)           │
└─────────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                      │
        ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐

    ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
    │                 │                 │
    ▼                 ▼                 ▼
┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│   App 1  │    │   App 2  │    │   App N  │
│ (Vercel) │    │ (Vercel) │    │ (Vercel) │
└──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘
```

Each app is independently deployed to Vercel with its own:
- GitHub integration
- Environment variables
- Build configuration
- Deployment URL

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### npm install failures
- Ensure `workspace:*` dependencies are converted to `file:` paths
- Use `npm install --force` to bypass peer dependency issues
- Check that all required packages exist in the monorepo

### Build failures
- Verify TypeScript configuration is correct
- Check for missing environment variables
- Ensure all imports resolve correctly

### Authentication issues
- Verify Supabase environment variables are set
- Check CORS configuration for distributed deployment
- Ensure session management works across domains
