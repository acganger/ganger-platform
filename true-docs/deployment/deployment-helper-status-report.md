# Deployment Helper Status Report

**Date**: June 27, 2025  
**Time**: 2:30 PM EDT

## Current Status

### Code Status ✅
- Deployment-helper has been properly restored with all @ganger/* packages
- Configuration files updated with proper monorepo settings
- Critical comments added to prevent future removal of packages
- Changes committed and pushed to GitHub

### Deployment Status ❌
- Manual CLI deployments are failing due to cached build configuration
- Vercel is using old settings with `cd ../.. && npm install` which fails
- GitHub integration does not appear to be triggering automatic deployments

## Recent Deployment Attempts

| Time | Status | Issue |
|------|--------|-------|
| 11m ago | ❌ Error | Using cached config with cd ../.. |
| 12m ago | ❌ Error | Using cached config with cd ../.. |
| 2h ago | ✅ Ready | Old version without packages (broken) |

## Root Cause

1. **Build Cache Issue**: Vercel is caching the old build configuration
2. **GitHub Integration**: Not set up or not triggering for this project
3. **Monorepo Challenge**: The deployment needs to happen from repository root

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Set Up GitHub Integration (Recommended)
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Navigate to the deployment-helper project
3. Connect it to GitHub repository
4. Configure it to deploy from repository root
5. Set build command to use workspace

### Option 2: Clear Build Cache
1. In Vercel Dashboard, go to project settings
2. Clear build cache
3. Redeploy

### Option 3: Create New Project
1. Delete the current deployment-helper project in Vercel
2. Create a new one with proper GitHub integration
3. Configure from the start with monorepo settings

## Key Learning

The deployment-helper code is now correct, but Vercel's build cache and lack of GitHub integration are preventing successful deployment. This aligns with the documentation stating that successfully deployed apps use GitHub integration, not CLI deployment.

*The fix is complete in code, but deployment requires Vercel Dashboard configuration*
