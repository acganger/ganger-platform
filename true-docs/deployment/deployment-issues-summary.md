# Deployment Issues Summary - June 27, 2025

## Current Status
- **7/17 apps successfully deployed** via Vercel
- **10/17 apps failing** due to monorepo dependency resolution issues
- **deployment-helper app removed** - it was a misunderstanding

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Core Problem
Vercel is attempting to install and build apps in isolation, but they depend on workspace packages (`@ganger/*`) that use the `file:../../packages/*` protocol. When Vercel runs `cd ../.. && npm install`, it fails because:

1. The build environment doesn't properly handle the monorepo structure
2. The `workspace:*` protocol in package.json files causes npm errors
3. Vercel's build cache is persisting old configurations

### Why 7 Apps Work
The successfully deployed apps (Inventory, Handouts, Staff, etc.) likely:
- Were deployed with different Vercel project settings
- Have their dependencies pre-bundled
- Use GitHub integration that handles monorepo builds differently

### Why 10 Apps Fail
The failing apps (EOS L10, Batch Closeout, etc.) are:
- Trying to resolve workspace dependencies at build time on Vercel
- Using vercel.json configurations that don't work with the monorepo structure
- Suffering from cached build configurations

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. Deployment Helper App ❌
- **Attempt**: Created app to build and cache all @ganger/* packages
- **Result**: Failed - the app itself couldn't deploy with workspace dependencies
- **Learning**: This was a fundamental misunderstanding of how Vercel handles monorepos

### 2. Modified vercel.json ❌
- **Attempt**: Updated build commands to use turbo scripts
- **Result**: Still fails with "cd ../.. && npm install" error
- **Learning**: The install command is the blocker, not the build command

### 3. Direct CLI Deployment ❌
- **Attempt**: Deploy using npx vercel with various flags
- **Result**: Same errors persist
- **Learning**: CLI deployment uses the same build process as GitHub integration

### 4. Environment Configuration ✅
- **Success**: Added proper .npmrc configuration
- **Success**: Added build scripts to root package.json
- **Success**: Documented correct deployment approach

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Access Vercel Dashboard
The engineer's feedback strongly suggests accessing the Vercel dashboard to:
- Check project settings for the 7 working apps
- Clear build cache for failing apps
- Configure proper monorepo settings

### 2. Use GitHub Integration
- Ensure all Vercel projects are connected to GitHub
- Let GitHub Actions handle the build process
- Avoid manual CLI deployments

### 3. Alternative: Local Pre-Building
If dashboard access isn't available:
1. Install pnpm locally
2. Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm build` for each app
3. Deploy the pre-built output to Vercel

### 4. Fix workspace: Protocol
Convert all `workspace:*` references to `file:` paths in package.json files to make npm compatible.

## Key Learnings

1. **No deployment-helper needed** - Each app should be self-contained after local build
2. **Monorepo deployment is complex** - Vercel needs specific configuration for workspace dependencies
3. **Build cache causes issues** - Old configurations persist between deployment attempts
4. **Local bundling is key** - Apps need dependencies bundled before Vercel deployment

## Action Items for User

1. **Access Vercel Dashboard**
   - Compare settings between working and failing apps
   - Clear build cache for failing apps
   - Update project configurations

2. **Use Deployment Scripts**
   - Fix scripts to use `npx vercel` instead of `vercel`
   - Ensure scripts run from correct directories
   - Add proper error handling

3. **Consider Alternative Approaches**
   - GitHub Actions for automated deployment
   - Local build + deploy strategy
   - Vercel's monorepo templates
