# Google Workspace Integration Implementation Summary

As of January 7, 2025, 10:00 PM EST

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enabled Google Workspace Service Files
- Renamed `google-workspace-service.ts.disabled` back to `google-workspace-service.ts`
- Renamed `google-sync.ts.disabled` back to `google-sync.ts`
- These files were previously disabled to reduce build time

### 2. Updated User Creation API (`/api/users/index.ts`)
- Added Google Workspace integration to automatically create users in Google Workspace when creating them in the database
- When a new user is created:
  1. User is created in the local database
  2. System attempts to create matching Google Workspace account
  3. User is added to the `/Google Cloud Identity` organizational unit
  4. User is added to the `gci-users@gangerdermatology.com` group
  5. Department and manager information is set in Google Workspace
- If Google Workspace creation fails, the local user is still created (graceful degradation)

### 3. Fixed TypeScript Issues
- Updated all API routes to create Supabase clients inside functions (not at module level)
- Fixed authentication to use NextAuth sessions
- Corrected TypeScript type narrowing issues

### 4. Added Error Handling
- Service checks for missing credentials before attempting Google API calls
- Clear error messages guide administrators on how to set up the integration
- System continues to function even if Google Workspace is not configured

### 5. Created Documentation
- Added comprehensive setup guide at `/true-docs/google-workspace-setup.md`
- Includes step-by-step instructions for:
  - Creating service account
  - Configuring domain-wide delegation
  - Setting up environment variables
  - Testing the integration

## Current Status

### ✅ Code Ready
- All TypeScript files are properly updated
- Google Workspace service is integrated with user creation
- Admin sync endpoints are available for bulk operations

### ⚠️ Configuration Required
To fully enable the integration, you need to:

1. **Create Google Cloud Service Account**
   - Go to Google Cloud Console
   - Create service account with Admin SDK permissions
   - Download JSON key file

2. **Add to Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
   ```

3. **Configure Domain-Wide Delegation**
   - Add service account to Google Admin console
   - Grant required scopes for user/group management

## Features Available

### Automatic User Creation
When creating a user through the Ganger Actions admin interface:
- Google Workspace account is automatically created
- User is placed in correct OU and group
- Manager relationship is established
- Department/location data is synced

### Admin Sync Tools (`/api/admin/google-sync`)
- **Validate Configuration**: Test Google Workspace connection
- **Sync Single User**: Update existing user in Google Workspace
- **Bulk Sync**: Sync all active users at once
- **Create Workspace User**: Manually create Google account for database user

### Google Workspace User Management
The service supports:
- Creating users with temporary passwords
- Updating user information (department, manager, phone, etc.)
- Suspending/restoring users
- Managing group memberships
- Bulk operations for efficiency

## Next Steps

1. **Obtain Service Account Credentials**
   - Follow the setup guide to create service account
   - Add credentials to environment variables

2. **Test the Integration**
   - Use the validation endpoint to verify configuration
   - Try creating a test user
   - Check Google Admin console to confirm user creation

3. **Sync Existing Users**
   - Use bulk sync feature to update all existing users
   - Verify manager relationships and departments are correct

## Security Considerations

- Service account private key must be kept secure
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Monitor Google Admin audit logs for activity
- Regularly rotate service account keys

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify domain-wide delegation is configured
3. Ensure impersonation email has Super Admin privileges
4. Review Google Admin audit logs for specific errors
5. Check application logs for detailed error messages

The integration is designed to fail gracefully - if Google Workspace is unavailable or not configured, the application will continue to function with local user management only.
