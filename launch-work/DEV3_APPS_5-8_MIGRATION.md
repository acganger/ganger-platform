- ‚úÖ **Build**: SUCCESS - 15 pages with PWA support
- ‚úÖ **Features**: Level 10 meetings, offline support, team collaboration
- ‚úÖ **Status**: Ready for immediate deployment

#### **Migration Tasks**
1. **Update Wrangler Configuration**
   ```toml

- ‚úÖ **Build**: SUCCESS - Professional scheduling interface
- ‚úÖ **Features**: TimeTrade replacement, multi-location booking
- ‚úÖ **Status**: Ready for immediate deployment

#### **Migration Tasks - DUAL INTERFACE REQUIRED**

1. **Create Two Worker Configurations**

   **File**: `apps/pharma-scheduling/wrangler-reps.toml`
   ```toml
   name = "ganger-reps-booking"
   main = "worker-reps.js"
   route = "reps.gangerdermatology.com/*"
   
   [env.production]
   name = "ganger-reps-booking"
   ```

   **File**: `apps/pharma-scheduling/wrangler-staff.toml`
   ```toml
   name = "ganger-reps-staff"  
   main = "worker-staff.js"
   route = "staff.gangerdermatology.com/reps/*"
   
   [env.production]
   name = "ganger-reps-staff"
   ```

2. **Create Two Worker Files**

   **File**: `apps/pharma-scheduling/worker-reps.js`
   ```javascript
   // Pharma Rep Access - Booking focused
   export default {
     async fetch(request) {
       // Serve rep-facing booking interface
       // External authentication (pharma company login)
       // Focus on appointment booking, availability viewing
       // TimeTrade replacement functionality
     }
   }
   ```

   **File**: `apps/pharma-scheduling/worker-staff.js`
   ```javascript
   // Staff Access - Management focused
   export default {
     async fetch(request) {
       // Serve staff management interface
       // Google OAuth authentication required
       // Focus on schedule management, rep approval, analytics
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Interface Differentiation**
   - **Rep Interface**: Clean booking flow, company branding support, mobile optimized
