## üìä **Current Platform Status**

### **From Comprehensive Assessment** (`/apptest/`)
- **13 out of 17 applications** production-ready
- **100% infrastructure readiness** (Supabase, Cloudflare, Google OAuth)
- **76% immediate deployment readiness**
- **Enterprise-grade security** implemented

### **Critical Issues to Resolve**

## üîÑ **Coordination Requirements**

### **Sequential Dependencies**
1. **Dev 1 MUST complete first** - All documentation and architecture
2. **Dev 2-5 can work in parallel** after Dev 1 completion
3. **Dev 6 waits for Dev 2-5 completion** before platform verification

### **Communication Protocol**
- **Daily standups** to report progress and blockers
- **Immediate escalation** for any infrastructure or dependency issues
- **Cross-dev coordination** for shared component usage
- **Dev 6 verification** of each developer's work before final deployment

### **Quality Gates**
- **No developer proceeds** without successful builds
- **All TypeScript errors** must be resolved
- **All identified issues** from assessment must be fixed
- **No modifications** to working infrastructure values

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Success Factors**

### **Infrastructure Preservation**
- **DO NOT modify** working environment variables in `/CLAUDE.md`
