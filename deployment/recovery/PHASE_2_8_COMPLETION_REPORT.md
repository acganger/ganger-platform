## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### **Rollback System Usage**
```bash
# Initialize rollback and disaster recovery system
./deployment/recovery/rollback-system.sh init

# Create deployment snapshot before deployment
./deployment/recovery/rollback-system.sh create-snapshot deploy_123 "staff inventory handouts"

# Execute manual rollback with reason
./deployment/recovery/rollback-system.sh rollback "performance_degradation" "staff inventory"

# Activate disaster recovery for complete system failure
./deployment/recovery/rollback-system.sh disaster-recovery "complete_system_failure" "all"

# Declare emergency for critical application failure
./deployment/recovery/rollback-system.sh emergency "critical_application_failure" "staff"

# Test recovery procedures
