## üõ†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Deployment Issues

#### Issue: Deployment Fails with "Build Error"
```bash
# Symptoms:
# - TypeScript compilation errors
# - Missing dependencies
# - Build artifacts not generated

# Diagnosis:
cd apps/[application-name]
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run build

# Solutions:
# 1. Fix TypeScript errors
npm run type-check 2>&1 | grep error

# 2. Install missing dependencies
npm install

# 3. Clear build cache
rm -rf .next .vercel node_modules
npm install
npm run build

# 4. Check for forbidden static export configuration
grep -r "output.*export" next.config.js
# Remove any "output: 'export'" configurations
```

#### Issue: Wrangler Deployment Fails
```bash
# Symptoms:
# - "Error: Authentication required"
# - "Error: Invalid wrangler configuration"
# - "Error: Failed to publish"

# Diagnosis:
wrangler whoami
wrangler deployments list
cat wrangler.jsonc | jq .

# Solutions:
# 1. Re-authenticate with Cloudflare
wrangler auth login

# 2. Verify environment variables
echo $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
echo $CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID

# 3. Validate wrangler configuration
jq empty wrangler.jsonc
