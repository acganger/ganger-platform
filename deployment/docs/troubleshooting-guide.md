## 🔧 DEPLOYMENT ISSUES

### Issue: TypeScript Compilation Errors

#### Symptoms
```bash
# Error messages like:
error TS2307: Cannot find module 'date-fns'
error TS2322: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
error TS2304: Cannot find name 'process'
```

#### Diagnosis
```bash
# Check TypeScript compilation
cd apps/[application-name]
npm run type-check

# Check package.json dependencies
cat package.json | jq .dependencies

# Verify node_modules installation
ls -la node_modules/ | grep -E "(date-fns|@types)"
```

#### Solutions
```bash
# Solution 1: Install missing dependencies
npm install date-fns
npm install @types/node

# Solution 2: Fix type errors
# Edit source files to fix type mismatches
# Add proper type annotations

# Solution 3: Clear and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Solution 4: Use native JavaScript replacements
# Replace date-fns with native Date methods
# Example: date-fns format() → new Date().toLocaleDateString()
```

#### Prevention
```bash
# Add to package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx",
    "build": "next build"
  }
}

# Run before deployment
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run build
```

### Issue: Next.js Build Failures

#### Symptoms
```bash
# Build errors like:
Error: Export 'default' was not found in './components/Component'
Error: Static generation failed
Error: Module not found: Can't resolve 'module-name'
```

#### Diagnosis
```bash
# Check build output
npm run build 2>&1 | tee build.log

# Check for static export conflicts
grep -r "output.*export" next.config.js

# Verify import/export statements
grep -r "import.*from" src/ | grep -v node_modules
```

#### Solutions
```bash
# Solution 1: Remove static export configuration
# Edit next.config.js, remove:
# output: 'export'

# Solution 2: Fix import/export issues
# Ensure proper default exports
export default function Component() { ... }

# Solution 3: Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm run build

# Solution 4: Check for circular dependencies
npm run build -- --profile
```

#### Worker-Specific Issues
```bash
# Cloudflare Workers incompatibilities:
# 1. Remove static export
# 2. Ensure edge runtime compatibility
# 3. Use @cloudflare/next-on-pages

# Fix wrangler.jsonc configuration:
{
  "name": "app-name",
  "main": ".vercel/output/static/_worker.js/index.js",
  "compatibility_date": "2024-01-01"
}
```

### Issue: Wrangler Deployment Failures

#### Symptoms
```bash
# Wrangler errors:
Error: Authentication required
Error: Failed to publish worker
Error: Invalid configuration
Error: Build failed
```

#### Diagnosis
```bash
# Check authentication
wrangler whoami

# Verify configuration
cat wrangler.jsonc | jq .

# Check build artifacts
ls -la .vercel/output/static/_worker.js/

# Test local build
npm run build
```

#### Solutions
```bash
# Solution 1: Re-authenticate
wrangler auth login
# Or set API token
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your_token"

# Solution 2: Fix wrangler configuration
# Ensure valid JSON format
jq empty wrangler.jsonc

# Solution 3: Rebuild worker
rm -rf .vercel
npm run build
npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages

# Solution 4: Check worker size limits
du -sh .vercel/output/static/_worker.js/
# Should be < 1MB
```

#### TOML Configuration Issues
```bash
# Problem: Mixed TOML and JSONC files
# Solution: Remove all .toml files
find . -name "wrangler.toml" -delete

# Use only wrangler.jsonc files:
{
  "name": "app-name",
  "main": ".vercel/output/static/_worker.js/index.js",
  "compatibility_date": "2024-01-01",
  "routes": [
    {
      "pattern": "app.gangerdermatology.com/*",
      "custom_domain": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Issue: Environment Variable Problems

#### Symptoms
```bash
# Runtime errors:
Error: CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN is not defined
Error: Database connection failed
Error: OAuth configuration missing
```

#### Diagnosis
```bash
# Check environment variables
env | grep -E "(CLOUDFLARE|SUPABASE|GOOGLE)"

# Verify in deployment script
cat deployment/scripts/deploy-master.sh | grep -A5 "check_environment"

# Check wrangler secrets
wrangler secret list
```

#### Solutions
```bash
# Solution 1: Set missing environment variables
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your_token"
export CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID="ba76d3d3f41251c49f0365421bd644a5"

# Solution 2: Update wrangler secrets
wrangler secret put SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

# Solution 3: Check .env files
cat .env.example
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with actual values

# Solution 4: Verify in application
# Add environment validation in app startup
if (!process.env.REQUIRED_VAR) {
  throw new Error('REQUIRED_VAR not configured');
}
```

### Escalation Levels

#### Level 1: Automated Response (0-5 minutes)
```bash
# Automated systems handle:
✓ Health check failures
✓ Performance threshold violations
✓ Security event detection
✓ Automatic rollback triggers

# No human intervention required
# Systems self-heal when possible
```

#### Level 2: IT Team Response (5-30 minutes)
```bash
# IT team notified for:
✓ System administrator intervention
✓ Manual diagnostic procedures
✓ Recovery procedure execution
✓ Infrastructure troubleshooting

# Response actions:
# - Execute diagnostic procedures
# - Implement recovery solutions
# - Coordinate with vendors
# - Document incident details
```

#### Level 3: Management Escalation (30-60 minutes)
```bash
# Management escalation for:
✓ Business impact assessment
✓ External stakeholder notification
✓ Vendor escalation procedures
✓ Resource allocation decisions

# Escalation contacts:
# - Practice Manager
# - Medical Director
# - IT Director
# - Compliance Officer
```

#### Level 4: Executive Escalation (60+ minutes)

✓ Data breach incidents
✓ Regulatory notification required
✓ Business continuity activation

# Executive response:
# - CEO/President notification
# - Board of directors briefing
# - Legal counsel involvement
# - Public relations coordination
```

### Escalation Decision Matrix

#### Impact Assessment
```bash
# Low Impact:
# - Single application affected
# - No patient care disruption
# - Backup procedures available
# Response: Level 1-2

# Medium Impact:
# - Multiple applications affected
# - Minor patient care disruption
# - Manual procedures required
# Response: Level 2-3

# High Impact:
# - Critical applications affected
# - Significant patient care disruption
# - Business continuity required
# Response: Level 3-4

# Critical Impact:
# - Complete system failure
# - Patient safety concerns
# - Regulatory implications
# Response: Level 4 + external experts
```

#### Escalation Timing
```bash
# Immediate escalation (< 5 minutes):
# - Data breach suspected
# - Patient safety concerns
# - Complete system failure
# - Security incident

# Rapid escalation (< 30 minutes):
# - Multiple system failures
# - Performance degradation
# - Authentication failures
# - Compliance violations

# Standard escalation (< 60 minutes):
# - Single application issues
# - Configuration problems
# - Performance optimization
# - Routine maintenance issues
```
