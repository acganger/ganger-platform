# ðŸš€ Fully Automated Vercel Deployment

## Overview

This is a complete automated deployment solution for your Ganger Platform monorepo using Vercel's latest features. No manual steps, no workarounds - just pure automation.

## Prerequisites

1. **Create a Vercel Account**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up with GitHub
   - This links your GitHub account automatically

2. **Get Your Vercel Token**
   - Go to [vercel.com/account/tokens](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)
   - Create a new token with full scope
   - Copy the token

3. **Set Your Token**
   ```bash
   export VERCEL_TOKEN='your-token-here'
   ```

## One-Command Deployment

```bash
# From your monorepo root
cd /mnt/q/Projects/ganger-platform

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x vercel-*.sh

# Deploy all apps
./vercel-automated-deploy.sh
```

That's it! This will:
- Install Vercel CLI if needed
- Deploy all your apps from the monorepo
- Each app gets its own Vercel project
- Automatic builds on every git push

## Environment Variables

To set up environment variables for all apps:

```bash
./vercel-setup-env.sh
```

This reads your `.env` file and adds all variables to each Vercel project.

## What Happens

1. **Vercel Auto-Detects**:
   - Your pnpm monorepo structure
   - Next.js framework
   - Build commands (`next build`)
   - Output directories

2. **Each App Gets**:
   - Its own URL: `ganger-[app-name].vercel.app`
   - Automatic HTTPS
   - Global CDN
   - Automatic deployments on git push

3. **No Configuration Needed**:
   - Vercel handles all the complexity
   - Workspace dependencies work automatically
   - Shared packages are built correctly

## Custom Domains

After deployment, you can add custom domains in Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Click "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
3. Add your domain (e.g., `inventory.gangerdermatology.com`)
4. Update DNS in Cloudflare to point to Vercel

## DNS Configuration

For each app, add a CNAME record in Cloudflare:
```
inventory.gangerdermatology.com â†’ cname.vercel-dns.com
handouts.gangerdermatology.com â†’ cname.vercel-dns.com
l10.gangerdermatology.com â†’ cname.vercel-dns.com
```

## Monitoring Deployments

Check deployment status:
```bash
vercel ls
```

View logs:
```bash
vercel logs ganger-inventory
```

## Benefits Over Previous Approaches

| Previous Issues | Vercel Solution |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Cloudflare Worker limits (50ms, 1MB) | No limits - full Node.js runtime |
| Complex build scripts | Standard `next build` |
| Static export workarounds | Dynamic SSR/API routes work |
| Manual nginx/PM2 config | Automatic scaling |
| VM maintenance | Fully managed platform |
| Deployment failures | Automatic rollbacks |

## The Deployment Engineer Was Right

This approach:
- Uses the correct `next build` command
- Requires zero configuration
- Works perfectly with pnpm monorepos
- Is the gold standard for Next.js
- Takes minutes, not hours

## Troubleshooting

If a deployment fails:
```bash
# Check build logs
vercel logs ganger-[app-name] --output=raw

# Redeploy
vercel --prod apps/[app-name]
```

## Next Steps

1. Run the automated deployment
2. Configure custom domains
3. Update Cloudflare DNS
4. Delete all the workaround files and scripts

Your apps will be live in minutes with proper, sustainable deployment.
