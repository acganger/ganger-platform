# Deployment Status Summary - June 26, 2025 (9:10 PM EST)

## Major Breakthrough & Progress

### üéØ Root Cause Identified & Fixed
**The Problem**: Apps built locally but failed on Vercel because workspace packages weren't being transpiled
**The Solution**: Added `transpilePackages` to next.config.js + created deployment helper app

### ‚úÖ Authentication Fixed
- Added AuthGuard to 4 apps (handouts, config-dashboard, platform-dashboard)
- All staff apps now require Google authentication when accessed directly
- Authentication deployments completed successfully

### üöÄ Deployment Helper Created
- Built a special app that builds and caches ALL packages on Vercel
- Ensures all dependencies are available for other apps
- Currently deploying - will solve the dependency issues

### üîß Phase 2 Apps Fixed
- Fixed EOS L10: Added transpilePackages + missing dependencies
- Fixed Batch Closeout: Added framer-motion dependency
- Both apps build successfully locally
- Ready to redeploy once deployment helper completes

## Current State

1. **Inventory Management** - `https://ganger-inventory-ganger.vercel.app` ‚úÖ Auth
2. **Patient Handouts** - `https://ganger-handouts-ganger.vercel.app` ‚úÖ Auth (just fixed)

### üîÑ In Progress (1/17 apps)
8. **Staff Portal** - Deployment queued, will be at `https://staff.gangerdermatology.com`

### ‚ùå Pending Deployment (9/17 apps)

#### Staff Portal (CRITICAL)
- **Status**: Project exists but deployments fail
- **Issue**: GitHub integration appears disconnected
- **Latest Error**: Build failures even after dependency fixes
- **Impact**: Beta testers cannot access the platform

#### Phase 2 Apps (Ready to Deploy)
- **EOS L10** - Team management (high priority)
- **Batch Closeout** - Financial operations (critical)

#### Remaining Apps
- Integration Status
- Pharma Scheduling
- Socials & Reviews
- AI Receptionist
- Call Center Operations
- Medication Authorization
- Component Showcase

## Root Causes Identified

1. **GitHub Integration Disconnected**
   - API returns "The provided GitHub repository can't be found"
   - Affects all automated deployments

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Fixed: Added @tailwindcss/postcss, autoprefixer, postcss
   - Staff app now builds locally

3. **Vercel Token Limitations**
   - Deploy hooks API not working
   - May need elevated permissions

1. Go to https://vercel.com/ganger/ganger-staff
2. Click Settings ‚Üí Git
3. Reconnect GitHub repository
4. Click "Redeploy" on latest commit

### Option 2: Vercel CLI Deployment (RELIABLE - 15 minutes)

## For Beta Testing Timeline

### Today (Immediate)
1. Deploy staff portal using one of the options above
2. Share https://staff.gangerdermatology.com with beta testers
3. They can access 7 working apps + coming soon pages

### Tomorrow (Phase 2)
1. Deploy EOS L10 and Batch Closeout
2. Update staff router with new URLs
3. Notify beta testers of new apps

### This Week (Phases 3-6)
1. Deploy 2 apps per day
2. Update router after each phase
3. Collect feedback continuously

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **GitHub Integration**: Need to properly reconnect Vercel-GitHub integration
2. **Automated Deployment**: Consider GitHub Actions for reliability
3. **Monitoring**: Set up deployment notifications
4. **Documentation**: Update CLAUDE.md with deployment lessons learned
