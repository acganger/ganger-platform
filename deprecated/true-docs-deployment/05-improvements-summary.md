## Summary of Changes

Based on the deployment engineer's excellent feedback, we've made the following improvements:

### 1. **Environment Variable Security** ✅
- Created `deployment-env.secret.example` template
- Updated deployment script to load from secure file
- Script now sets variables for both production AND preview environments
- Uses `vercel env add` which doesn't expose secrets in logs
- Added warning when using hardcoded values

### 2. **Staff Portal Deployment Warning** ✅
- Added CRITICAL warning that staff portal deployment makes everything live
- Emphasized this is the final step to production
- Clear indication that testing must be complete before this step

### 3. **CLAUDE.md Clarification** ✅
- Documented that CLAUDE.md is our internal AI assistant documentation
- Contains platform configuration and architectural decisions
- Used by AI assistants to understand the codebase

### 4. **basePath Configuration Clarity** ✅
- Updated checklist with nuanced basePath guidance
- Added detection in pre-deployment check for link patterns
- Clear guidance: Keep basePath if using relative links, remove if using absolute
- Added testing note for client-side navigation

### 5. **CORS Configuration** ✅
- Created `packages/utils/src/cors.ts` with proper CORS handling
- Includes all allowed origins including Vercel preview URLs
- Added CORS checklist items for API routes
- Provides `withCors` wrapper for easy API route protection

## Key Security Improvements

1. **No hardcoded secrets in deployment script**
   - Uses environment variable file
   - Falls back to defaults with warning

2. **Secure environment variable handling**
   - Uses Vercel CLI's secure input methods
   - Sets for both production and preview
   - No secrets appear in logs

3. **CORS protection for distributed architecture**
   - Prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests
   - Allows staff portal to communicate with all apps
   - Supports development and preview environments

## Usage Instructions

### Before Deployment:
```bash
# 1. Create your secure environment file
cp deployment-env.secret.example deployment-env.secret

# 2. Edit with your actual values
# DO NOT commit this file!

# 3. Run pre-deployment checks
node scripts/pre-deployment-check.js
```

### During Deployment:
```bash
# The script will automatically:
# - Load environment variables from deployment-env.secret
# - Set them for both production and preview
# - Deploy without exposing secrets
./scripts/vercel-deploy-all-apps.sh
```

### For API Routes in Apps:
```typescript
// Use the CORS wrapper in your API routes
import { withCors } from '@ganger/utils/cors';

export default withCors(async (req, res) => {
  // Your API logic here
  res.json({ data: 'secure response' });
});
```

## Next Steps

1. Review the updated documentation
2. Create `deployment-env.secret` with production values
3. Test CORS configuration with a sample deployment
4. Proceed with phased deployment plan

All feedback has been incorporated to ensure a secure, reliable deployment process.
