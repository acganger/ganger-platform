# Deprecated Files - Moved from Active Project

## Overview

This folder contains 80+ files that were moved from the project root as they are obsolete for the new **Vercel Distributed Deployment** strategy. These files relate to abandoned deployment approaches:

1. **Cloudflare Workers Deployment** (abandoned due to platform limitations)
2. **VM Tunnel Deployment** (abandoned due to complexity)
3. **Clean Architecture** (5-worker Cloudflare system, obsolete)
4. **GitHub Actions Pre-build** (failed approach documented in VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_HISTORY.md)

## File Categories Moved

### ❌ **VM Deployment Scripts** (20+ files)
- **Files**: All vm-*.sh, deploy-*vm*.sh, setup-vm-deployment.sh, clean-vm-deploy.sh, etc.
- **Purpose**: Various VM deployment automation scripts

- **Purpose**: Documentation for 5-worker Cloudflare architecture  
- **Status**: OBSOLETE for Vercel strategy
- **Reason**: All relate to abandoned Cloudflare Workers approach

### ❌ **VM Deployment Documentation** (7 files)
- **Files**: SYSTEMATIC_VM_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md, VM_COMMANDS.md, VM_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md, VM_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md, VM_MANUAL_SETUP.md, VM_SETUP_QUESTIONS.md
- **Purpose**: Various VM deployment guides and setup instructions
- **Status**: OBSOLETE for Vercel strategy
- **Reason**: VM tunnel approach was abandoned due to complexity

### ❌ **General Deployment Documentation** (8+ files)
- **Files**: DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md, DEPLOYMENT_APPROACH_CLARIFICATION.md, DEPLOYMENT_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md, DEPLOYMENT_FIX_SUMMARY.md, DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md, DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_L10.md, DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION_SUMMARY.md, FINAL_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md
- **Purpose**: Various deployment guides for non-Vercel approaches
- **Status**: OBSOLETE for Vercel strategy
- **Reason**: All focus on Workers/VM deployment methods that were abandoned

### ❌ **Cloudflare Routing Documentation** (8 files)
- **Files**: APP_ROUTING_CHECKLIST.md, ROUTE_VERIFICATION_RESULTS.md, ROUTING_FIXES_SUMMARY.md, ROUTING_TEST_SUMMARY.md, etc.
- **Purpose**: Cloudflare Workers routing setup and troubleshooting
- **Status**: OBSOLETE for Vercel strategy
- **Reason**: All focus on Workers routing which is no longer used

### ❌ **Obsolete Deployment Tools** (Special files)
- **DELETE_AND_REBUILD.sh**: Nuclear option script to delete all Cloudflare Workers and rebuild clean architecture
- **GITHUB_ACTIONS_DEPLOYMENT.md**: GitHub Actions for pre-build deployment (failed approach)

## Why These Files Were Removed

### Context from VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_HISTORY.md

The new Vercel strategy was adopted after systematic testing proved that:

1. **Single Monorepo Deployment** failed - "No Next.js version detected"
2. **Staff Portal with Local Path Rewrites** failed - Module not found errors
3. **GitHub Actions Pre-Build + Deploy** failed - Vercel still tries to build
4. **Direct Vercel CLI from Monorepo Root** failed - Can't find Next.js
5. **Cloudflare Workers** failed - Platform limitations (50ms, 1MB limits)
6. **VM Tunnel** failed - Too complex and maintenance-heavy

### The Solution: Distributed Architecture

The working solution is:
- Each app deploys independently to Vercel
- Staff Portal acts as intelligent router using URL rewrites
- No monorepo complexity, standard Next.js deployments
- Vercel handles each as a simple project

## Files That Define the NEW Strategy (Kept in Root)

These files were preserved as they define the current approach:
- **VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md** - Current deployment strategy
- **VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_HISTORY.md** - Critical decision context  
- **VERCEL_AUTOMATED_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Automation tooling
- **VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** - Implementation guide

## Recovery Information

If any of these files are needed for reference:
1. They remain in this deprecated folder
2. Git history preserves all versions
3. The working Vercel strategy is documented in the 4 files listed above

## Moved Date

- **Analysis Date**: January 2025
- **Files Moved**: 80+ project root files
- **Confidence Level**: HIGH (clear patterns identified)
- **Reason**: Clean up project root for new Vercel deployment strategy
