# ðŸš€ Deploy RIGHT NOW - Simple Steps

Since you already have:
- âœ… GitHub connected to Vercel
- âœ… Environment variables configured at team level
- âœ… Your team ID: team_wpY7PcIsYQNnslNN39o7fWvS

## Quick Deploy via Dashboard

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/ganger/stores

2. **Click**: "Create a New Project"

3. **Select**: "Import Git Repository" â†’ `acganger/ganger-platform`

4. **Configure EACH app**:
   - **Project Name**: `ganger-inventory` (or whatever app)
   - **Root Directory**: Click "Edit" â†’ Select `apps/inventory`
   - **Framework**: Will auto-detect Next.js
   - **Build Command**: Leave default (it will use turbo)
   - **Environment Variables**: Already set at team level âœ…

5. **Click**: "Deploy"

## Apps to Deploy

Start with these (they're the most complete):
1. `apps/inventory` â†’ Name: `ganger-inventory`
2. `apps/handouts` â†’ Name: `ganger-handouts`
3. `apps/eos-l10` â†’ Name: `ganger-eos-l10`
4. `apps/checkin-kiosk` â†’ Name: `ganger-checkin-kiosk`
5. `apps/medication-auth` â†’ Name: `ganger-medication-auth`

## After Deployment

1. Each app gets a URL like: `ganger-inventory.vercel.app`
2. Add custom domains later in project settings
3. Update Cloudflare DNS to point to Vercel

## That's It!

No scripts, no CLI issues, just:
- Import â†’ Select app folder â†’ Deploy

The deployment engineer was right - Vercel just works with Next.js monorepos.
