## üí° KEY FINDINGS

### What Went Right
1. **Infrastructure Works:** Cloudflare Workers architecture is solid
2. **Routing Logic:** Staff portal correctly proxies to individual workers  
3. **Application Quality:** Professional-grade medical applications
4. **Documentation Accuracy:** Claims matched actual deployment status
5. **Build Process:** Multiple apps build successfully and are deployment-ready
