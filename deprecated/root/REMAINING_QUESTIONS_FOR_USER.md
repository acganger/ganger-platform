# Remaining Questions for User - Ganger Platform Development
*Critical clarifications needed for AI-completable codebase*

## üéØ Executive Summary

Based on the comprehensive PRD analysis and standardization, I've identified key areas where user input is essential for creating a fully AI-completable codebase. The foundation and technical architecture are solid, but specific business logic, UI/UX details, and integration parameters require clarification.

## üîç Critical Questions Requiring User Input

### 1. **User Interface & Experience Design**

#### **Design System Specifications**
```typescript
// NEED CLARIFICATION: Exact color values and design tokens
colors: {
  primary: 'blue-600',      // Confirm exact shade
  secondary: 'green-600',   // Medical/health theme appropriate?
  accent: 'purple-600',     // Analytics theme color
  // Need specific Hex values for brand consistency
}

// NEED CLARIFICATION: Typography and spacing specifications
typography: {
  // What font families should we use?
  // Headings, body text, and medical terminology formatting?
}
```

**Questions:**
- Do you have existing brand guidelines or color schemes to follow?
