# MCP Architecture: Claude vs Your Applications

## 🔍 **Key Distinction:**

MCP servers are **Claude's development tools**, NOT part of your application runtime.

## 📊 **Two Separate Architectures:**

### **MCP Servers (Development Tools)**
```
Claude Desktop/Code ←→ MCP Servers ←→ External Services
     (You)              (Tools)         (MySQL, Sheets, etc.)
```

### **Your Applications (Runtime)**
```
Next.js Apps ←→ API Routes ←→ Direct Database Connections
  (Users)        (Your Code)     (Supabase, MySQL, etc.)
```

## 🛠️ **MCP Servers are for YOU (the developer):**

- **Purpose**: Help Claude assist you with development
- **Access**: Only available in Claude Desktop/Code sessions
- **Location**: Run on your local machine
- **Function**: Tools for Claude to help you code, query databases, manage files

## 🚀 **Your Apps Use Direct Connections:**

Your Next.js applications will connect directly to services:

```typescript
// Your app code - NOT using MCP
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
import mysql from 'mysql2/promise'

// Direct database connections
const supabase = createClient(url, key)
const mysqlConnection = mysql.createConnection(config)
```

## 📋 **Example Workflow:**

### **Development Phase (Using MCP):**
1. **You**: "Claude, show me the staff_tickets table structure"
2. **Claude**: Uses MySQL MCP → queries your legacy database → shows you the schema
3. **You**: "Help me create a migration script"
4. **Claude**: Uses the MCP data to generate migration code for your app

### **Runtime Phase (Your App):**
1. **User**: Visits your Next.js staff app
2. **Your App**: Connects directly to Supabase (not through MCP)
3. **Your Code**: Handles user requests with direct database queries

## 🔧 **What You're Building:**

```
Your Next.js Apps:
├── apps/staff/
│   ├── src/api/           # Direct Supabase connections
│   ├── lib/database.ts    # Your connection logic
│   └── pages/             # User interface
├── packages/
│   ├── @ganger/db/        # Your database utilities
│   └── @ganger/auth/      # Your auth system
```

```
MCP Servers (Development Only):
├── mcp-servers/
│   ├── mysql-legacy/      # Helps Claude access legacy data
│   ├── google-sheets/     # Helps Claude manage project data
│   └── supabase/          # Helps Claude with dev database
```

## 💡 **Key Takeaway:**

- **MCP servers** = Claude's tools to help you develop
- **Your applications** = Run independently with direct service connections
- **They don't interact** - completely separate architectures

Your users will never see or use MCP servers. They're exclusively for Claude to assist you during development!
