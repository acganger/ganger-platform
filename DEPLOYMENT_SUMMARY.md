2. **✅ Created 3 missing Vercel projects**:
   - ganger-checkout-slips
   - ganger-deployment-helper
   - ganger-llm-demo

3. **✅ Added essential environment variables to all 20 projects**:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
   - DATABASE_URL
   - DIRECT_URL
   - ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COREPACK=1

## 📊 Current Status (as of 18:57 EST)

### Summary:
- **✅ Successfully Deployed**: 2/20
- **🔄 Currently Building**: 14/20  
- **❌ Failed**: 4/20

### Successfully Deployed Apps:
1. ✅ **inventory** - https://ganger-inventory-ku776x04t-ganger.vercel.app
2. ✅ **handouts** - https://ganger-handouts-61zkj0ygi-ganger.vercel.app

### Still Building (14 apps):
- medication-auth, platform-dashboard, component-showcase, config-dashboard
- compliance-training, clinical-staffing, integration-status, eos-l10
- batch-closeout, pharma-scheduling, socials-reviews, ai-receptionist
- call-center-ops, checkin-kiosk

### Failed Apps (4):
1. **deployment-helper** - Helper app for monorepo dependencies
2. **staff** - Main router/portal app (CRITICAL)
3. **checkout-slips** - New development app
4. **llm-demo** - New development app

## 🔧 Key Fixes Applied:

1. **Package Manager Standardization**:
   - Removed conflicting `package-lock.json`
   - Standardized on pnpm@8.15.0
   - All apps use consistent vercel.json configuration

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - All projects have ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COREPACK=1
   - Supabase credentials configured
   - Database connections set up

3. **Build Configuration**:
   ```json
   {
     "installCommand": "cd ../.. && NODE_ENV=development pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile",
     "buildCommand": "cd ../.. && pnpm -F @ganger/[app-name] build",
     "outputDirectory": ".next",
     "framework": "nextjs"
   }
   ```

## 🎯 Next Steps:

1. **Wait for remaining 14 apps to complete building** (est. 5-10 minutes)

2. **Fix failed apps**:
   - Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
   - Common issues: TypeScript errors, missing dependencies
   - Development apps (checkout-slips, llm-demo) may have incomplete code

3. **Retry failed deployments** with:
   ```bash
   ./retry-failed-deployments.sh
   ```

## 📈 Expected Final State:

When complete, you should have:
- 20 deployed Next.js applications
- All using pnpm package manager
- Shared monorepo packages working correctly
- Staff portal routing to all sub-applications
