# Medical Apps Deployment Summary

**Date**: January 19, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Deployed (Cache purge needed)

## üè• What Was Done

### 1. Fixed App Configurations
All 4 medical apps were updated to use static export:
- ‚úÖ **Inventory Management** (`/inventory`)
- ‚úÖ **Patient Handouts** (`/handouts`)
- ‚úÖ **Medication Authorization** (`/meds`)
- ‚úÖ **Check-in Kiosk** (`/kiosk`)

### 2. Built and Deployed Apps
- Removed edge runtime declarations that were causing build errors
- Built all apps as static exports with proper asset paths
- Uploaded all files to their respective R2 buckets:
  - `inventory-management-production`
  - `handouts-production`
  - `medication-auth-production`
  - `checkin-kiosk-production`

### 3. Fixed Router Configuration
- Updated `staff-portal-router` to handle subroutes (e.g., `/inventory/*` not just `/inventory`)
- Added R2 bucket bindings for all medical apps
- Deployed router with proper configuration

## üö® Current Issue: Cache

The apps are deployed but Cloudflare is serving cached versions (24-hour cache). 

### To Fix:
1. **Option 1**: Purge cache in Cloudflare Dashboard
   - Go to Caching ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Custom Purge
   - Enter: `https://staff.gangerdermatology.com/inventory/*`
   
2. **Option 2**: Wait ~24 hours for cache to expire

3. **Option 3**: Update the API token to include cache purge permissions

## üìã Next Steps for Other Apps

The same fix pattern applies to all other apps:

1. **Add to `next.config.js`**:
   ```javascript
   output: 'export',
   ```

2. **Remove edge runtime declarations** from all files

3. **Build and upload to R2**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Upload out/* to R2 bucket
   ```

4. **Update router** to handle the app's routes

## üîç Verification

Once cache is cleared, test at:
- https://staff.gangerdermatology.com/inventory
- https://staff.gangerdermatology.com/handouts
- https://staff.gangerdermatology.com/meds
- https://staff.gangerdermatology.com/kiosk

The apps should load with:
- Proper styling (CSS loading correctly)
- Dynamic content (no more black screens)
- Functional navigation

## üìù Technical Details

### Architecture:
- **Static Export**: Next.js apps built as static HTML/CSS/JS
- **R2 Storage**: Files stored in Cloudflare R2 buckets
- **Worker Routing**: `staff-portal-router` serves files from R2
- **Asset Paths**: Apps use `/appname/_next/` for assets

### Key Files Modified:
- `apps/*/next.config.js` - Added static export
- `cloudflare-workers/staff-router.js` - Fixed subroute handling
- `wrangler-staff-portal-router.toml` - Added R2 bindings

## ‚úÖ Success Metrics

When working correctly:
1. No more "Origin DNS error" messages
2. Apps load with proper styling
3. JavaScript functionality works
4. Pages are not blank/black
5. Assets load from correct paths
