# üîç Deployment Verification Checklist

## üö® Critical Pre-Check: Script Review Analysis

### Script Compatibility Assessment:
- **01-deploy-all-apps.sh**: ‚ùå **INCOMPATIBLE** - Uses old Vercel CLI approach
- **02-pre-deployment-check.js**: ‚úÖ **SAFE** - Only validates, doesn't modify
- **03-update-staff-rewrites.js**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS VERIFICATION** - May conflict with our setup
- **04-verify-deployment.sh**: ‚úÖ **SAFE** - Only tests, doesn't modify
- **05-emergency-rollback.sh**: ‚úÖ **SAFE** - Good to have ready

### Key Conflicts Found:
1. **Their deployment script** creates new projects each time (we already created them)
2. **Their script** uses hardcoded tokens (we have GitHub secrets configured)
3. **Their approach** deploys from temp directories (we have GitHub Actions)
4. **Path mismatch**: Scripts expect to run from `/true-docs/deployment/scripts/`

## ‚úÖ What We've Already Completed

### 1. **Infrastructure Setup** ‚úÖ
- [x] Removed Cloudflare Workers artifacts (70+ files)
- [x] Created 17 Vercel projects with proper naming
- [x] Configured GitHub Secrets (tokens + project IDs)
- [x] Set environment variables for all projects
- [x] GitHub Actions workflows created

**Verification Method 1**: Check Vercel Dashboard
```bash
# All 17 projects should exist:
ganger-inventory, ganger-handouts, ganger-eos-l10, etc.
```

**Verification Method 2**: Check GitHub Secrets
```bash
gh secret list
# Should show: VERCEL_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, all project IDs
```

### 2. **Automation Setup** ‚úÖ
- [x] Created `vercel-deploy.yml` workflow
- [x] Created `deploy-single-app.yml` for manual deploys
- [x] Test deployment triggered for component-showcase

**Verification**: Check GitHub Actions
- URL: https://github.com/acganger/ganger-platform/actions
- Should show workflow runs

## üîÑ Current Status

### What's Happening Now:
1. **GitHub Actions** deployment in progress - Fixed issues:
   - ‚úÖ Removed git submodule error (legacy-a2hosting-apps/staff)
   - ‚úÖ Fixed pnpm lockfile mismatch in compliance-training
   - ‚úÖ Fixed GitHub push protection (removed claude_desktop_config files)
   - ‚úÖ Fixed build commands to use turbo filter
   - ‚è≥ Testing compliance-training deployment
2. **Documentation Updates Completed**:
   - ‚úÖ Removed hardcoded tokens from 01-deploy-all-apps.sh
   - ‚úÖ Removed temp directory usage
   - ‚úÖ Updated script to use GitHub secrets
   - ‚úÖ Added warning that script is INCOMPATIBLE with our setup
3. **Current Issue**: Build compilation error in compliance-training
   - Error: `TypeError: n.createContext is not a function`
   - Likely edge runtime compatibility issue

### How to Verify Current Deployment:
```bash
# Check GitHub Actions status
# URL: https://github.com/acganger/ganger-platform/actions

# Check latest run
gh run list --limit=5

# View specific run details
gh run view [run-id] --log-failed
```

## üìã Next Steps Verification Checklist

### Step 1: Verify Test Deployment ‚è≥
Before proceeding, confirm:
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
- [ ] Vercel shows successful deployment
- [ ] Component showcase is accessible at deployment URL
- [ ] No build errors in logs

**Verification Commands**:
```bash
# Get deployment URL from Vercel
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.vercel.com/v9/projects/ganger-component-showcase/deployments?teamId=$VERCEL_TEAM_ID&limit=1"

# Test the deployment
curl -I <deployment-url>
```

### Step 2: Pre-Deployment Validation üîç
**SAFE TO RUN** - Only checks, no modifications:
```bash
cd /mnt/q/Projects/ganger-platform
node true-docs/deployment/scripts/02-pre-deployment-check.js
```

**Expected Issues to Fix**:
- [ ] Remove any console.log statements
- [ ] Remove localhost references
- [ ] Remove demo/test files
- [ ] Fix TypeScript errors (if any)

### Step 3: Deploy Remaining Apps üöÄ
**DO NOT** use their `01-deploy-all-apps.sh` script!

**Instead, use our GitHub Actions**:
1. Make a small change to each app
2. Commit and push
3. Let GitHub Actions handle deployment

**OR** use manual deployment:
```bash
# Deploy one app at a time
gh workflow run deploy-single-app.yml -f app=inventory
gh workflow run deploy-single-app.yml -f app=handouts
# ... etc
```

### Step 4: Update Staff Portal Routes üîÑ
After all apps are deployed:

**First, collect all deployment URLs**:
```bash
# Create deployment-urls.json manually by checking each Vercel project
# OR extract from GitHub Actions logs
```

**Then update staff router**:
```bash
# This updates apps/staff/vercel.json with routes
node scripts/update-vercel-rewrites.js
```

**Verify before deploying**:
```bash
# Check the generated vercel.json
cat apps/staff/vercel.json
```

### Step 5: Deploy Staff Portal (Critical!) üéØ
**This makes everything LIVE!**
```bash
# Deploy staff portal through GitHub Actions
gh workflow run deploy-single-app.yml -f app=staff
```

### Step 6: Post-Deployment Verification ‚úÖ
Run comprehensive tests:
```bash
# Use their verification script (safe to run)
./true-docs/deployment/scripts/04-verify-deployment.sh
```

**Manual Verification**:
- [ ] Access https://staff.gangerdermatology.com
- [ ] Test each app route (/inventory, /handouts, etc.)
- [ ] Check authentication flow
- [ ] Verify cross-app navigation
- [ ] Check browser console for errors

### Step 7: Configure Custom Domains üåê
In Vercel Dashboard:
- [ ] Add `staff.gangerdermatology.com` to ganger-staff
- [ ] Add `lunch.gangerdermatology.com` to ganger-pharma-scheduling
- [ ] Add `kiosk.gangerdermatology.com` to ganger-checkin-kiosk

### Step 8: Monitor First 24 Hours üìä
- [ ] Check Vercel Analytics for errors
- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions for failed deployments
- [ ] Test critical user flows
- [ ] Check performance metrics

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If Something Goes Wrong:
1. **Stop all deployments immediately**
2. **Check error logs in**:
   - GitHub Actions logs
   - Vercel deployment logs
   - Browser console
3. **Use rollback if needed**:
   ```bash
   ./true-docs/deployment/scripts/05-emergency-rollback.sh
   ```

### Common Issues & Solutions:

**Build Failures**:
- Check package.json dependencies
- Verify environment variables
- Check TypeScript errors

**Routing Not Working**:
- Verify staff/vercel.json has correct URLs
- Check if apps deployed successfully first
- Ensure no basePath conflicts

**Authentication Issues**:
- Verify Google OAuth credentials
- Check NEXTAUTH_URL matches deployment
- Ensure cookies domain is correct

## üìä Success Criteria

### Deployment is successful when:
1. ‚úÖ All 17 apps deployed to Vercel
2. ‚úÖ Staff portal routes to all apps correctly
3. ‚úÖ Authentication works across apps
4. ‚úÖ No console errors in browser
5. ‚úÖ Custom domains configured and working
6. ‚úÖ All verification tests pass

## ‚è∞ Timeline Estimate

Based on our setup:
- **Test deployment verification**: 10 minutes
- **Pre-deployment fixes**: 30-60 minutes
- **Deploy all apps**: 1-2 hours (via GitHub Actions)
- **Staff portal configuration**: 30 minutes
- **Verification & testing**: 30 minutes
- **Domain configuration**: 30 minutes

**Total**: 3-4 hours (less than their estimate!)

## üéØ Final Reminders

1. **DO NOT RUSH** - Better to go slow and verify each step
2. **VERIFY TWICE** - Use both automated and manual checks
3. **DOCUMENT ISSUES** - Keep notes of any problems
4. **HAVE ROLLBACK READY** - Know how to undo if needed

---

**Current Step**: Troubleshooting Vercel deployment errors
**Fixes Applied**: 
- ‚úÖ Removed edge runtime from all apps
- ‚úÖ Fixed GitHub Actions workflow_dispatch syntax error
- ‚úÖ Fixed project ID secret mapping with shell script
- ‚úÖ Updated deployment scripts (removed tokens & temp dirs)
- ‚úÖ Builds complete successfully locally

**Current Issue**: 
- Vercel deployment starts but fails with "Unexpected error"
- Deployment URL created: https://ganger-component-showcase-jfda95eqy-ganger.vercel.app
- Build begins but encounters unknown error

**Next Actions**:
1. Check Vercel dashboard for error details
2. Verify project settings and permissions
3. Try manual Vercel CLI deployment
4. Consider creating fresh Vercel project

**Risk Level**: Low (infrastructure ready, just deployment config issue)
