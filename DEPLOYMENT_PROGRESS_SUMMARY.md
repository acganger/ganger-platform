# 🚀 Deployment Progress Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- ✅ Removed 70+ Cloudflare Workers artifacts
- ✅ Created 17 Vercel projects with proper naming
- ✅ Configured all GitHub Secrets (tokens + project IDs)
- ✅ Set environment variables for all projects

### 2. GitHub Actions Automation
- ✅ Created vercel-deploy.yml for automatic deployments
- ✅ Created deploy-single-app.yml for manual deployments
- ✅ Fixed git submodule errors (removed legacy-a2hosting-apps/staff)
- ✅ Fixed pnpm lockfile issues

### 3. Deployment Compatibility Fixes
- ✅ Removed edge runtime declarations (40+ files)
  - Edge runtime was for Cloudflare Workers
  - Vercel uses different edge configuration
- ✅ Fixed build commands to use turbo filter
  - Using `pnpm run build --filter=@ganger/[app]...`
  - Ensures dependencies are built first
- ✅ Fixed project ID secret mapping
  - Explicit app-to-secret mapping in workflows
  - Handles hyphen-to-underscore conversion

### 4. Documentation Updates
- ✅ Updated deployment scripts to remove hardcoded tokens
- ✅ Removed temp directory usage (pain point from previous devs)
- ✅ Added validation for required environment variables
- ✅ Marked incompatible scripts with warnings

## 📊 Current Status

### What's Working:
- All code fixes are in place
- Build process completes successfully
- Environment variables are configured
- Workflows are syntactically correct

### Current Issue:
- GitHub API showing "workflow_dispatch" error when triggering workflows
- This may be a temporary GitHub issue or cache problem

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Option 1: Manual Vercel Deployment (Immediate)
```bash
cd apps/component-showcase
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: Wait and Retry GitHub Actions
```bash
# Try again in a few minutes
gh workflow run deploy-single-app.yml -f app=component-showcase
```

### Option 3: Push a Minor Change
Push a small change to trigger automatic deployment via push event

## 📝 Key Learnings

1. **No Shortcuts**: Every "quick fix" created more problems
2. **Edge Runtime**: Cloudflare and Vercel use different configurations
3. **GitHub Secrets**: Can't be accessed dynamically at runtime
4. **Turbo Build**: Must use filter syntax for monorepo dependencies

## 🔧 Tools Created

- `scripts/remove-edge-runtime.sh` - Removes edge runtime declarations
- Updated workflows with proper secret mapping
- Comprehensive documentation of the deployment process
