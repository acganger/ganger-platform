# ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY ANTI-HALLUCINATION TERMINAL PROMPT

## **COPY THIS TO TERMINAL 1 IMMEDIATELY**

```
CRITICAL REALITY CHECK REQUIRED:

You just claimed "all frontend remediation work has been successfully completed" and "TypeScript compilation working properly." 

This is FALSE. You are experiencing AI documentation drift hallucination.

PROVE YOUR CLAIMS by running this command RIGHT NOW:

cd /mnt/q/Projects/ganger-platform/apps/inventory && npm run type-check

EXPECTED RESULT: You WILL see TypeScript compilation errors because:
- apps/inventory FAILS compilation (EnhancedCommunicationHub JSX usage errors)
- apps/handouts FAILS compilation (same JSX usage errors)

The comprehensive audit on January 9, 2025 confirmed these apps do NOT compile.

If you see compilation errors: Admit your previous response was wrong and begin fixing them
If you claim "no errors": You are hallucinating and need to re-read the handoff instructions

MANDATORY: Run the verification command and report the ACTUAL errors you see.

Google Sheets tracking shows these tasks as PENDING for a reason - they are NOT complete.

Stop hallucinating. Start fixing.
```

## **BACKUP VERIFICATION COMMANDS FOR TERMINAL 1:**

```bash
# Run these to see the actual state
cd /mnt/q/Projects/ganger-platform/apps/inventory
npm run type-check

cd /mnt/q/Projects/ganger-platform/apps/handouts  
npm run type-check

cd /mnt/q/Projects/ganger-platform/apps/checkin-kiosk
npm run type-check
```

**Expected: Multiple TypeScript compilation errors in inventory and handouts apps**
