## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:

### **Real-time IDS Collaboration**
```typescript
// IDS workflow with real-time updates
const useRealTimeIDS = (issueId: string) => {
  const [issueState, setIssueState] = useState<IDSState>('identify');
  const [participants, setParticipants] = useState<Participant[]>([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = supabase
      .channel(`ids-${issueId}`)
      .on('postgres_changes', {
        event: '*',
        schema: 'public',
        table: 'issues',
        filter: `id=eq.${issueId}`
      }, (payload) => {
        // Update IDS state and participants
        updateIDSWorkflow(payload);
      })
      .subscribe();

    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
  }, [issueId]);

  return { issueState, participants, updateState: setIssueState };
};
```

### **Smart Todo Assignment**
```typescript
// Intelligent todo assignment with workload balancing
const TodoAssignmentEngine = {
  calculateOptimalAssignment: (todo: TodoDraft, teamMembers: TeamMember[]) => {
    const workloadScores = teamMembers.map(member => ({
      member,
      currentLoad: calculateCurrentWorkload(member.id),
      skillMatch: calculateSkillMatch(todo.requiredSkills, member.skills),
      availability: calculateAvailability(member.id, todo.dueDate)
    }));

    return workloadScores
      .sort((a, b) => {
        const aScore = (a.skillMatch * 0.4) + (a.availability * 0.3) + ((1 - a.currentLoad) * 0.3);
        const bScore = (b.skillMatch * 0.4) + (b.availability * 0.3) + ((1 - b.currentLoad) * 0.3);
        return bScore - aScore;
      })
      .slice(0, 3); // Return top 3 suggestions
  }
};
```

### **GWC Assessment Interface**
```typescript
// GWC evaluation with scoring matrix
const GWCAssessmentForm = ({ teamMember }: { teamMember: TeamMember }) => {
  const [scores, setScores] = useState<GWCScores>({
    getIt: 0,
    wantIt: 0,
    capacity: 0
  });

  const handleScoreChange = (dimension: keyof GWCScores, score: number) => {
    setScores(prev => ({ ...prev, [dimension]: score }));
    
    // Real-time save
    saveDraftAssessment(teamMember.id, { ...scores, [dimension]: score });
  };

  return (
    <div className="gwc-assessment">
      <GWCScoreSlider 
        label="Get It (Understanding)" 
        value={scores.getIt}
        onChange={(score) => handleScoreChange('getIt', score)}
      />
      <GWCScoreSlider 
        label="Want It (Desire)" 
        value={scores.wantIt}
        onChange={(score) => handleScoreChange('wantIt', score)}
      />
      <GWCScoreSlider 
        label="Capacity (Ability)" 
        value={scores.capacity}
        onChange={(score) => handleScoreChange('capacity', score)}
      />
      <GWCOverallScore scores={scores} />
    </div>
  );
};
```
