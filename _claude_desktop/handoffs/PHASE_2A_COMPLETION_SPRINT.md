## üîÑ **COORDINATION STRATEGY**

### **Parallel Development Approach**:
```yaml
Week 1:
- Terminal 1: Meeting Prep Dashboard + Polish begins
- Terminal 2: Public booking interface + calendar integration
- Coordination: Daily progress sync, quality checkpoints

Week 2:
- Terminal 1: Final testing + production deployment
- Terminal 2: Admin interface + final testing
- Coordination: Final integration testing, deployment preparation
```

### **Quality Gates Maintained**:
