**Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Project Name:** Telehealth Audio Transcription Integration

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 26, 2025

---

**1. Introduction**
This document outlines the requirements for integrating Zoom telehealth meetings with our existing EHR system to automatically record and transcribe meeting audio. The primary goal is to streamline documentation for clinical visits while maintaining HIPAA compliance.

**2. Goals**
* **Automate:** Minimize manual effort in recording and transcribing telehealth visits.
* **Accuracy:** Achieve high accuracy in transcribing medical conversations.
* **Compliance:** Ensure all processes and data handling adhere to HIPAA regulations.
* **Efficiency:** Reduce time spent by clinicians on documentation.

**3. Scope**
The scope of this project is limited to:
* Capturing audio from Zoom telehealth meetings.
* Transcribing the captured audio into text.
* Securely sending the transcription to our existing EHR via a pre-established API.

**Out of Scope:**
* Video recording or processing.
* Real-time in-meeting summaries or AI interactions.
* Development of the EHR API (already exists).
* Any features beyond recording and transcription.

**4. Key User Flows**

* **Meeting Start:**
    1.  A clinician starts a telehealth meeting in Zoom.
    2.  The integration automatically detects the meeting.
    3.  The integration begins capturing audio from the meeting.
* **Meeting End:**
    1.  The Zoom meeting ends.
    2.  The integration finalizes audio capture.
    3.  The captured audio is securely sent for transcription.
* **Transcription & EHR Integration:**
    1.  The transcription service processes the audio.
    2.  The resulting text transcript is securely returned to our system.
    3.  Our system uses the existing secure EHR API to push the transcript into the relevant patient record.
    4.  Confirmation of successful EHR update is logged.

**5. Functional Requirements**

* **FR.1 - Audio Capture:** The system SHALL securely capture the audio stream from Zoom telehealth meetings in real-time or post-meeting.
    * *Note:* Given HIPAA constraints, direct raw audio capture via Zoom Meeting SDK is preferred over Zoom's cloud recording/transcription if those are disabled on our HIPAA plan.
* **FR.2 - Audio Quality:** The captured audio SHALL be of sufficient quality for accurate AI transcription, minimizing background noise and ensuring clear speaker distinction.
* **FR.3 - Transcription Service Integration:** The system SHALL integrate with a third-party, HIPAA-compliant AI transcription service specializing in medical terminology.
* **FR.4 - Transcription Accuracy:** The transcription service SHALL provide highly accurate transcripts of medical conversations.
* **FR.5 - Speaker Diarization:** The transcription service SHALL accurately identify and differentiate speakers (e.g., "Clinician:", "Patient:").
* **FR.6 - Secure Data Transfer:** All audio data sent to the transcription service, and all transcripts received, SHALL be encrypted in transit (e.g., TLS 1.2+).
* **FR.7 - EHR Integration:** The system SHALL utilize the existing secure EHR API to push the final transcription into the appropriate patient record within the EHR.
* **FR.8 - Error Handling & Logging:** The system SHALL implement robust error handling for audio capture, transcription, and EHR integration, with detailed logging for troubleshooting and auditing.

**6. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **NFR.1 - Security & Compliance (HIPAA):**
    * **NFR.1.1:** A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) MUST be in place with Zoom.
    * **NFR.1.2:** A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) MUST be in place with the chosen AI transcription service.
    * **NFR.1.3:** All data (audio, transcripts) containing PHI MUST be encrypted at rest and in transit.
    * **NFR.1.4:** Access to the integration components and data MUST be strictly controlled and auditable (least privilege).
    * **NFR.1.5:** The solution MUST operate within our organization's existing HIPAA-compliant Zoom environment.
* **NFR.2 - Reliability:** The system SHALL be highly reliable, ensuring consistent audio capture and transcription for all telehealth visits.
* **NFR.3 - Scalability:** The system SHALL be scalable to handle our projected volume of telehealth meetings.
* **NFR.4 - Performance:** Transcriptions should be processed and available in the EHR within a reasonable timeframe post-meeting (e.g., within 5-10 minutes for short visits).

**7. Technical Specifications (Preliminary)**

* **Zoom API Version:** **v2** (current stable version)
    * *Rationale:* This is the established REST API for managing meetings and accessing related data.
* **Zoom SDK Version (for Audio Capture):** **Meeting SDK for [Platform - e.g., Linux, Windows, macOS] version 6.5.0** (or latest stable, e.g., `6.5.0` as of June 18, 2025).
    * *Rationale:* Provides direct access to raw audio streams for robust and compliant capture, especially if Zoom's cloud recording/transcription is restricted in our HIPAA environment. We will target the specific native platform most suitable for our server environment.
* **Authentication:** Server-to-Server OAuth (for Zoom API/SDK interactions).
* **Transcription Service:** TBD (must provide BAA and specialize in medical transcription).
* **EHR Integration:** Existing secure API (specifications provided separately).
* **Deployment Environment:** Secure, HIPAA-compliant cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP HIPAA-eligible services).

**8. Open Questions / Dependencies**

* Confirmation of specific limitations/features enabled within our organization's Zoom HIPAA account for cloud recording and transcription.
* Final selection and BAA negotiation with the chosen medical AI transcription service.
* Detailed technical specifications and authentication methods for the chosen AI transcription service.
