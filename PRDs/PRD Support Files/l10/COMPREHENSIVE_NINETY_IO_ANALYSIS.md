## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Low Risk Items ✅
- **Data Migration**: Complete data structure mapping available
- **User Authentication**: Working Google OAuth configuration
- **Core Functionality**: L10 app already 80-90% complete
- **Team Adoption**: EOS methodology already in use

### Medium Risk Items ⚠️
- **Deeper Data Scraping**: Current scraping captured surface-level data; production migration needs comprehensive extraction
- **User Training**: Team will need orientation on L10 app interface differences
- **Feature Gaps**: Some ninety.io specific features may need custom development

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Comprehensive Scraping**: Before production migration, run deeper scraping to capture all historical data, comments, attachments
2. **Parallel Testing**: Run both systems simultaneously during transition period
3. **Training Plan**: Create user guides and training sessions for team members
4. **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ninety.io access during initial migration period
