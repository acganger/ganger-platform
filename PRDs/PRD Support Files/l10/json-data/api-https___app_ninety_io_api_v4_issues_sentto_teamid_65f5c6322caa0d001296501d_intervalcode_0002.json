Due to new guidelines with insurance providers, we are no longer able to offer video visits for patients as a covered service. While we do not agree with this limitation on telehealth care, we must comply with the new guidance that will be effective as of April 1, 2025.\n\nAs always, we are happy to see you in person at any of our three clinic locations, but if you prefer the convenience of a video visit, we can still accommodate you. However, please note that any video visit on or after April 1, 2025 will not be submitted to your insurance provider, and payment will be required at the time of service as an out of pocket expense. The cost of the service varies depending on the issues discussed during the video visit and can range from $125-$175 per video visit.\n\nWe understand that this change may be inconvenient, and we remain committed to providing you with the highest level of care. If you have a video visit scheduled between now and April 1st, we will see you soon. But for those that are scheduled after April 1st, 2025, one of our staff will reach out to you to discuss your choice to either continue your care in person or talk through the process of continuing with the video visit option. If you would rather call us directly, we will be ready for you at 734-344-4567.\n\nThank you for trusting us with your care. We appreciate you being a part of our practice and look forward to continuing to serve you.\n\nKind regards,\nGanger Dermatology\n",

We have been made aware that Congress will be meeting with Medicare and other insurance representatives in March to discuss eliminating coverage for telemedicine visits. Should these new guidelines go into effect, we would no longer be able to offer video visits for patients as a covered service. While we do not agree with this limitation on telehealth care, we would have no choice but to comply with the new guidance that could take effect on April 1, 2025.\n\nAs we await final determination on these changes, we wanted to make you aware of what your options would be:\n\n1. You are always welcome to come in person for your visits.\n2. We can continue to see you via video visit, however, it would be an out of pocket expense with payment due at time of service. Cost of appointments varies depending on the issues discussed but would range from $125-175 per visit.\n3. Lastly, if coming in person is not feasible and the out of pocket expense is cost prohibitive, we understand that some patients may need to make the choice to transition care to a provider more geographically convenient. We will be happy to facilitate the transfer of care to the new office and supply any records needed to make the transition as smooth as possible. We certainly do not want to see you go but will fully support what is best for you and your care.\n\nWe understand that this change may be inconvenient and we are also coming to terms with how it will impact our ability to provide service for our patients. Despite this, we remain committed to providing you with the highest level of care. If you have a video visit scheduled between now and April 1st, we will be able to see you as planned. For those that are scheduled AFTER April 1st, 2025, one of our staff will reach out to you to discuss your choice to either transition your care to in person visits, talk through the process of continuing video visits as an out of pocket expense, or consider transferring care to another office. If you would rather call us directly, we will be ready for you at 734-344-4567.\n\nAt this time, we are unsure if the changes will go ahead as proposed but wanted to give you time to consider your options. Unfortunately, we have no control over this impactful decision but we will continue to keep you informed about the status of this issue as information becomes available.\n\nThank you for trusting us with your care. We appreciate you being a part of our practice and look forward to continuing to serve you.\n\nKind regards,\nGanger Dermatology",
