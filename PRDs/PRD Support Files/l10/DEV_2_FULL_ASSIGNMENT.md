# Dev 2: L10 App Production Migration & Deployment Assignment

**Project**: Ninety.io to L10 App Migration - Production Implementation  
**Developer**: Dev 2  
**Priority**: High (Production Ready)  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Branch Strategy**: `feature/l10-production-migration` (branched from Dev 6's work)

---

## 📋 Assignment Overview

You are tasked with completing the L10 app for production deployment by implementing comprehensive data migration from ninety.io and deploying the application. Dev 6 has completed the core L10 app functionality (80-90% complete), and your role is to finalize the migration, enhance missing features, and deploy to production.

**Key Constraint**: Do NOT modify Dev 6's existing polished code unless absolutely necessary for deployment or critical bug fixes.

---

## 🏗️ Development Strategy

### Branch Management
```bash
# Create your feature branch from Dev 6's latest work
git checkout dev-6-l10-app  # or whatever Dev 6's branch is named
git pull origin dev-6-l10-app
git checkout -b feature/l10-production-migration

# Work exclusively in your branch
# Only merge back when deployment is complete and tested
```

### Code Protection Strategy
1. **Preserve Dev 6's Architecture** - Do not refactor existing components
2. **Additive Development** - Only add new features, don't modify existing ones
3. **Separate Migration Code** - Keep all migration scripts in dedicated directories
4. **Configuration Only Changes** - Limit modifications to config files and environment setup

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Deep Data Scraping Implementation

Create comprehensive scraping beyond the surface-level data already captured:

```typescript
// apps/eos-l10/migration/scripts/deep-ninety-scraper.ts
export class DeepNinetyIoScraper {
  async scrapeCompleteData() {
    // 1. All historical rocks with complete milestone history
    // 2. All issues with full discussion threads
    // 3. All todos with complete history and assignments
    // 4. All scorecard data with historical trends
    // 5. All meeting notes and recordings
    // 6. All file attachments and documents
    // 7. All user activity and audit logs
  }
}
```

### 2. Database Migration Strategy

Use the provided migration scripts as a foundation, but enhance for production:

```sql
-- migration/scripts/002_production_data_migration.sql
-- Build upon the generated 001_migrate_ninety_io_data.sql
-- Add additional data integrity checks
-- Include rollback procedures
-- Add performance optimizations
```
