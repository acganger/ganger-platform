# PRD: Staff WiFi Network Profile System
**Project**: Automated Staff WiFi Authentication & Tracking  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 10, 2025  
**Author**: Anand Ganger  
**Status**: Planning  

---

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

Create an automated staff WiFi authentication system using Google OAuth integration and network profiles to enable seamless multi-site access while providing comprehensive employee location tracking for the legacy staff portal's punch-fix dashboard.

### **Business Problem**
- Staff personal devices use MAC randomization, making employee network tracking impossible
- Current WiFi access lacks centralized control and audit capabilities  
- No integration between network presence and time tracking systems
- Manual WiFi setup creates security vulnerabilities and poor user experience

### **Solution Overview**
Deploy WPA2-Enterprise WiFi with Google OAuth authentication across all 4 practice locations, enabling automatic profile distribution via SMS and real-time network presence verification in existing staff management systems.

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture**

### **Network Infrastructure**

#### **UniFi Controller Configuration**
```bash
# Synchronized across all 4 controllers:
- Main/Home: UDM SE (192.168.1.1)
- Ann Arbor: UDM Pro (50.238.160.230)  
- Plymouth: UDM Pro (50.216.114.162)
- Wixom: UDM Pro (50.238.161.46)

# Unified SSID: "GD-Staff-Secure"
Security: WPA2-Enterprise
Authentication: 802.1X with Google OAuth
RADIUS: FreeRADIUS proxy to Google LDAP
```

#### **Google Integration Architecture**
```bash
# Authentication Flow:
Employee Device ‚Üí WPA2-Enterprise ‚Üí UniFi Controller ‚Üí 
FreeRADIUS ‚Üí Google Cloud Identity ‚Üí Access Granted

# User Database: Existing Google Cloud Identity
Domain: gangerdermatology.com
Users: firstname.lastname@gangerdermatology.com
Groups: Staff role-based access control
```

### **Profile Distribution System**

#### **SMS Automation Pipeline**
```python
# Onboarding Workflow:
1. HR adds employee to Google Cloud Identity
2. Webhook triggers profile generation
3. Twilio MCP sends SMS with secure download link
4. Employee installs profile ‚Üí instant WiFi access
5. Google Sheets MCP logs deployment status
```

#### **Profile Generation Service**
```bash
# Profile Contents:
- SSID: "GD-Staff-Secure"
- Security: WPA2-Enterprise  
- Authentication: PEAP-MSCHAPv2
- Username: employee@gangerdermatology.com
- Certificate: Auto-provisioned via Google
```

### **Legacy Integration Layer**

#### **Punch-Fix Dashboard Enhancement**
```php
// Enhanced manager view in legacy staff portal:
// File: legacy-a2hosting-apps/staff/views/dashboard_table.php

function getNetworkPresenceData($employee_id, $date) {
    // Query UniFi controllers via MCP service
    $locations = ['ann_arbor', 'plymouth', 'wixom', 'main'];
    $presence_data = [];
    
    foreach ($locations as $location) {
        $presence_data[$location] = queryUniFiController(
            $location, 
            $employee_id, 
            $date
        );
    }
    
    return $presence_data;
}
```

#### **Network Verification Service**
```bash
# V1: Manual MFA authentication (current limitation)
# V2: Service account for automated queries

Service Endpoint: /api/network-verification
Input: employee_email, date_range
Output: {
  "locations": [
    {
      "site": "ann_arbor",
      "login_time": "2025-01-10T08:30:15Z",
      "logout_time": "2025-01-10T17:45:22Z", 
      "duration": "9h 15m",
      "access_point": "U7 Pro XG Central"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **MCP Server Integration**

#### **Required MCP Servers**
```bash
‚úÖ Twilio MCP: SMS profile distribution
‚úÖ Google Sheets MCP: Deployment tracking
‚úÖ UniFi Network MCP: Network presence queries  
‚úÖ Time MCP: HIPAA-compliant timestamping
‚úÖ Memory MCP: Store employee network patterns
```

#### **Network Verification API**
```typescript
// src/api/network-verification.ts
interface NetworkPresenceQuery {
  employee_email: string;
  date: string;
  locations?: string[];
}

interface NetworkPresenceResponse {
  employee: string;
  date: string;
  locations: LocationPresence[];
  total_hours: number;
  verified: boolean;
}

async function queryNetworkPresence(
  query: NetworkPresenceQuery
): Promise<NetworkPresenceResponse> {
  // V1: Manual MFA authentication
  // V2: Service account automation
}
```

### **Database Schema Updates**

#### **Staff Portal Enhancement**
```sql
-- Add network verification to existing punch_fix table
ALTER TABLE punch_fix ADD COLUMN network_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE punch_fix ADD COLUMN network_location VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE punch_fix ADD COLUMN network_login_time TIMESTAMP NULL;
ALTER TABLE punch_fix ADD COLUMN network_logout_time TIMESTAMP NULL;
ALTER TABLE punch_fix ADD COLUMN network_duration_minutes INT DEFAULT 0;

-- Create network presence log table
CREATE TABLE network_presence_log (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  employee_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  location VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  login_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  logout_time TIMESTAMP NULL,
  access_point VARCHAR(100),
  ip_address VARCHAR(15),
  mac_address VARCHAR(17),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  INDEX idx_employee_date (employee_email, DATE(login_time)),
  INDEX idx_location_date (location, DATE(login_time))
);
```

### **Security Considerations**

#### **Network Segmentation**
```bash
# Staff VLAN Configuration:
Staff Network: 10.1.20.0/24 (isolated from patient/guest)
Printer Access: Dynamic firewall rules per location
Medical Equipment: Role-based access control
Internet Access: Content filtering and monitoring
```

#### **Certificate Management**
```bash
# Certificate Lifecycle:
Issuance: Automatic via Google OAuth
Renewal: 90-day rotation with auto-renewal
Revocation: Instant via Google account disabling
Backup: Secure certificate store with audit trail
```
