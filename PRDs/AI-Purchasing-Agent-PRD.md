## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
Develop an AI-powered purchasing agent that intercepts medical supply procurement requests, performs real-time multi-vendor price comparison, and recommends optimal purchasing decisions to reduce costs and improve procurement efficiency for Ganger Dermatology.

### 1.2 Business Case
- **Current State**: $135,000 annual medical supply spending across fragmented vendors
- **Problem**: No centralized price comparison leading to 5-15% overspend
- **Opportunity**: $6,750-20,250 potential annual savings through intelligent procurement
- **Solution**: AI agent that analyzes purchase requests and optimizes vendor selection

### 1.3 Success Metrics
- **Primary**: 8-15% reduction in medical supply costs ($10,800-20,250/year)
- **Secondary**: 50% reduction in procurement decision time
- **Tertiary**: 90% contract compliance rate for GPO pricing

---

## 2. Market Research & Competitive Analysis

### 2.1 Current Procurement Workflow
1. Staff identifies need for supplies
2. Places order with preferred vendor (usually Henry Schein)
3. No price comparison across vendors
4. Manual approval for orders >$500
5. Post-purchase cost analysis (if any)

### 2.2 Pain Points
- **Price Variance**: Same items show 5-25% price differences across vendors
- **Contract Compliance**: Not consistently using GPO/Provista pricing
- **Time Inefficiency**: Manual vendor comparison for bulk orders
- **Missed Opportunities**: Volume discounts and bulk pricing overlooked
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Over-reliance on single vendor (Henry Schein)

### 2.3 Competitive Solutions
| Solution | Pros | Cons | Cost |
|----------|------|------|------|
| OpenMarkets | Medical-specific | $500/month | High |
| Vendorful | SMB focused | Limited medical | $299/month |
| Amazon Business | Free, integrated | Limited scope | $0 |
| Custom Solution | Tailored, no fees | Development cost | Development time |
