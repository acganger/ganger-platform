## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### **MANDATORY: Cloudflare Workers Architecture**
```yaml
# ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Workers-only deployment (Pages is sunset)
Framework: Next.js 14+ with Workers runtime (runtime: 'edge')
Deployment: Cloudflare Workers (NO Pages deployment)
Build Process: @cloudflare/next-on-pages
Configuration: Workers-compatible next.config.js (NO static export)

# ‚ùå FORBIDDEN: These patterns cause 405 errors
Static_Export: Never use output: 'export'
Cloudflare_Pages: Sunset for Workers routes
Custom_Routing: Must use Workers request handling
```

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Anti-Pattern Prevention**
```typescript
// ‚ùå NEVER USE: Static export configuration (causes 405 errors)
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',        // DELETE THIS - breaks Workers
  trailingSlash: true,     // DELETE THIS - static pattern
  distDir: 'dist'          // DELETE THIS - Workers incompatible
}

// ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Workers-compatible configuration
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    runtime: 'edge',         // MANDATORY for Workers
  },
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,       // Required for Workers
  },
  basePath: '/issues',       // Required for staff portal routing
}
```

### **Architecture Verification Requirements**
```bash
# ‚úÖ MANDATORY: Every app must pass these checks
pnpm type-check              # 0 errors required
pnpm build                   # Successful completion required
curl -I [app-url]/health     # HTTP 200 required (not 405)
grep -r "StaffPortalLayout"  # Must find implementation
grep -r "output.*export"     # Must find nothing
```

### **Shared Infrastructure with Pages Sunset Note**
```yaml
