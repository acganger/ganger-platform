4. **Audit Trail Implementation**: Complete HIPAA-compliant audit logging
5. **Performance Optimization**: Specialized indexes for RLS query optimization
6. **Data Integrity**: Proper constraints, checks, and referential integrity

#### Database Schema Highlights

```sql
-- Excellent example: medication_authorization_tables.sql
CREATE TABLE medication_authorizations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    patient_id UUID NOT NULL,
    provider_id UUID NOT NULL,
    
    -- AI processing integration
    ai_confidence_score DECIMAL(3,2) CHECK (ai_confidence_score >= 0 AND ai_confidence_score <= 1),
    ai_recommendation ai_recommendation_enum,
    estimated_approval_probability DECIMAL(3,2),
    
    -- HIPAA compliance fields
    created_by UUID,
    updated_by UUID,
    
    -- Performance constraints
    CONSTRAINT valid_quantity CHECK (quantity_requested > 0),
    CONSTRAINT logical_dates CHECK (
        (approved_at IS NULL OR submitted_at IS NOT NULL) AND
        (denied_at IS NULL OR submitted_at IS NOT NULL)
    )
);
```

#### ⚠️ **Minor Schema Considerations**
1. **Index Maintenance**: Some unused indexes may need cleanup (as noted in RLS optimization)
2. **Data Archival**: Long-term retention strategy for audit logs needs documentation
