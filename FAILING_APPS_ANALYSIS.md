# Failing Apps Analysis

*As of December 30, 2024 8:45 PM EST*

## Fixed npm → pnpm Issues

I found and fixed npm references in the following failing apps:

### 1. **pharma-scheduling** ✅ FIXED
- Had npm in vercel.json install and build commands
- Updated to use pnpm with proper monorepo commands

### 2. **staff** ✅ FIXED  
- Had npm in vercel.json install and build commands
- Updated to use pnpm with proper monorepo commands

### 3. **eos-l10** ✅ FIXED
- Had npm in package.json setup:l10 script
- Updated to use pnpm

## Current Status of Failing Apps

Based on recent Vercel API check:

### Apps Showing ERROR:
- integration-status
- pharma-scheduling 
- staff
- socials-reviews
- medication-auth

### Apps Showing READY but No Production URL:
- eos-l10
- batch-closeout
- ai-receptionist
- call-center-ops

### Apps Using Correct pnpm Configuration:
All 10 failing apps now have correct vercel.json with:
- `NODE_ENV=development pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`
- `pnpm -F @ganger/[app-name] build`
- Proper dependency builds (@ganger/auth, @ganger/ui, etc.)

## No Other Conflicts Found
- No .npmrc files in failing apps
- No package-lock.json files (using pnpm-lock.yaml)
- All vercel.json files now use consistent pnpm commands

## Next Steps
The npm → pnpm migration is complete for all failing apps. If deployments still fail, the issues are likely:
1. Missing environment variables
2. Code/import errors
3. Vercel project configuration issues

But all npm conflicts have been resolved.
