# üöÄ Deployment Guide - Getting Your Apps Running Properly

## The Problem
You're seeing static pages with mock data because the apps are being deployed as static HTML files instead of dynamic Next.js applications.

## Quick Solutions

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Easiest - 5 minutes)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# In each app directory
cd apps/inventory
vercel

# Follow prompts, it auto-detects Next.js
# Your app is live with full functionality!
```

### Option 2: Deploy to Cloudflare Workers (Your current infrastructure)
```bash
# Remove static export from next.config.js
# Remove this line: output: 'export'

# Use Next.js Edge Runtime
npm install @cloudflare/next-on-pages

# Build for Cloudflare Workers
npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages

# Deploy
wrangler pages deploy .vercel/output/static
```

### Option 3: Traditional Node.js Hosting
```bash
# Build normally
npm run build

# Start production server
PORT=3001 npm start

# Use reverse proxy (nginx/Cloudflare Tunnel) to expose it
```

## What Each Option Gives You

| Setup Time | Complex | 5 min | 30 min | 1 hour |

## Your Current Architecture Issues

1. **Static Export**: `output: 'export'` creates static HTML - no backend
2. **Mock Workers**: Some routes return hardcoded HTML
3. **No API Connection**: Static files can't talk to Supabase
4. **Auth Loops**: Static pages can't handle authentication

## Recommended Fix

Since you already have:
- Cloudflare account
- Supabase backend
- Next.js apps

**Use Cloudflare Pages with Functions:**
1. Remove `output: 'export'` from next.config.js
2. Deploy with `wrangler pages deploy`
3. Add environment variables in Cloudflare dashboard
4. Your apps work exactly as in development!

## Need Help?

The confusion is valid - the current setup is overly complex for what you need. The simplest path forward is:

1. Pick Vercel/Netlify for immediate results
2. Or fix the Cloudflare deployment to use Pages with Functions
3. Avoid static exports unless you truly need static sites
