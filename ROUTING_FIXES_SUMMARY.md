## 🏗️ Architecture Pattern Used

### For Dedicated Workers (Compliance, Staffing, Socials)
- These apps have their own Workers that handle all routes
- Fixed by adding missing Next.js pages in the app directories
- Each page includes:
  - `export const runtime = 'edge'`
  - `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
  - Dynamic content with timestamps and random values

### For Staff Router Apps
- These apps are handled by the main staff-portal-router
- Fixed by adding subroute detection in the router
- Pattern: `if (pathname.startsWith('/app/')) { return getAppSubroute(pathname); }`
- Each subroute handler generates dynamic HTML with navigation
