- Software problems
- Network issues
- General support requests

### Time Off Requests
- Paid time off (PTO)
- Unpaid leave

- Holiday awareness

### Additional Forms (Planned)

## API Integration

The frontend is designed to work with the backend API endpoints:

- `GET /api/tickets` - List tickets
- `POST /api/tickets` - Create ticket
- `GET /api/tickets/[id]` - Get ticket details
- `PUT /api/tickets/[id]` - Update ticket
- And more...
