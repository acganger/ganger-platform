The platform now uses Turborepo for intelligent change detection and optimized deployments:
- **Smart Change Detection**: Only deploys apps that have changed
- **Parallel Deployments**: Multiple apps deploy concurrently
- **Validation First**: All apps verified before deployment
- **5-10x Faster**: Single app deploys in 3-5 minutes (vs 25-35 minutes for all)

### **Key Commands**
```bash
# Verify apps before deployment
pnpm verify:changed      # Verify only changed apps
pnpm verify:app inventory # Verify specific app
pnpm verify:all          # Verify all apps

# Build and deploy
pnpm build:changed       # Build only changed apps
pnpm deploy:changed      # Deploy only changed apps

# Check deployment status
export VERCEL_TOKEN=your-token
node scripts/check-deployment-status.js
```

## 🚨 **Platform Updates (July 11, 2025)**

### **Enhanced Routing Architecture**
Based on Vercel expert recommendations, the platform is transitioning to a simpler routing approach:
- **New**: Static `vercel.json` rewrites for better performance (replacing Edge Config middleware)
- **Result**: Faster response times without middleware overhead

### **Key Improvements Implemented**
- ✅ **App Launcher**: Root path (`/`) shows all 17 apps as tiles for easy navigation
- ✅ **Performance**: Static rewrites eliminate middleware overhead
- ✅ **Enhanced Headers**: Better request tracking (x-forwarded-for, x-original-pathname)
- ✅ **Path Handling**: Fixed nested route issues (e.g., `/inventory/items/123`)
- ✅ **Automation Scripts**: API-based env var management and deployment triggers

### **New Commands**
```bash
# Manage environment variables
node scripts/verify-and-set-env-vars.js

# Update Edge Config (if using dynamic routing)
node scripts/update-edge-config.js

# Trigger deployment via API
node scripts/trigger-deployment.js
```
