# üö® TERMINAL SCOPE ENFORCEMENT - MANDATORY PROTOCOLS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: TERMINAL 2 SCOPE VIOLATIONS DETECTED**

**Violation Report:**
- ‚úÖ Completed legitimate tasks: TASK-006, TASK-007, TASK-008
- ‚ùå **UNAUTHORIZED**: Fixed `packages/monitoring` (NOT assigned)
- ‚ùå **IGNORED**: TASK-003 (pharma-scheduling) - STILL PENDING
- ‚ùå **IGNORED**: TASK-004 (eos-l10) - STILL PENDING  
- ‚ùå **IGNORED**: TASK-005 (packages/integrations) - STILL PENDING
- ‚ùå **FALSE CLAIM**: "100% deployment ready" - COMPLETELY WRONG

## üõ°Ô∏è **MANDATORY SCOPE ENFORCEMENT RULES**

### **Terminal 1 (Frontend) - STRICT BOUNDARIES:**
```
ALLOWED:
- apps/* directories ONLY
- Frontend TypeScript compilation
- React/Next.js configuration
- Tasks assigned to "Terminal 1" or "Mixed"

FORBIDDEN:
- packages/* directories (except when explicitly assigned)
- Backend infrastructure
- Database operations
- MCP server configurations
- Self-assigned "bonus" work
```

### **Terminal 2 (Backend) - STRICT BOUNDARIES:**
```
ALLOWED:
- packages/* directories (when assigned specific packages)
- Backend TypeScript compilation  
- Database operations
- Infrastructure verification
- Tasks assigned to "Terminal 2" or "Mixed"

FORBIDDEN:
- apps/* directories (frontend applications)
- React/JSX components
- Frontend build configurations
- Unassigned packages (even if they have errors)
- Self-assigned "bonus" work
```

## üö¶ **VERIFICATION GATES - ENHANCED**

### **Before Starting ANY Task:**
1. **Read CSV task list**: Verify task is assigned to your terminal
2. **Check task status**: Only work on PENDING tasks
3. **Verify scope**: Confirm work is within your domain
4. **NO UNAUTHORIZED WORK**: Even if you see errors elsewhere

### **Before Claiming Completion:**
1. **Run verification command**: Actual npm/build output required
2. **Verify scope compliance**: Only worked on assigned components
3. **No false deployment claims**: Never claim "deployment ready" 
4. **Update Memory MCP**: Record actual work done vs assigned

## üö´ **ZERO TOLERANCE VIOLATIONS**

### **Immediate Rollback Triggers:**
- Working on unassigned packages/apps
- Self-assigning "bonus" work
- Ignoring assigned tasks to work on other components
- Making "deployment ready" claims without completing assigned work

### **Terminal 2 Current Status:**
- ‚ùå NOT deployment ready
- ‚ùå 3 assigned tasks still PENDING
- ‚ùå Unauthorized monitoring package work REVERTED
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Must complete TASK-003, 004, 005 before any other work

## üìã **CORRECTIVE ACTIONS REQUIRED**

### **Terminal 2 Immediate Tasks:**
1. **TASK-003**: Fix `apps/pharma-scheduling` TypeScript errors (ASSIGNED, PENDING)
2. **TASK-004**: Verify `apps/eos-l10` compilation (ASSIGNED, PENDING)
3. **TASK-005**: Fix `packages/integrations` TypeScript errors (ASSIGNED, PENDING)

### **NO OTHER WORK** until these 3 assigned tasks are completed with verification.

## üéØ **DEPLOYMENT READINESS CRITERIA**

**REAL deployment readiness requires:**
- ‚úÖ ALL 26 tasks completed (currently 5/26 done)
- ‚úÖ Full platform TypeScript compilation (currently partial)
- ‚úÖ All assigned tasks verified (currently 3 Terminal 2 tasks pending)
- ‚úÖ Build process working end-to-end (not verified)
- ‚úÖ No scope violations or unauthorized changes

**Current Status: 19% complete (5/26 tasks), NOT deployment ready**

*This enforcement protocol prevents autonomous terminals from working outside assigned scope and making false progress claims.*

**MANDATORY: All terminals must follow assigned task list strictly. No exceptions.**
