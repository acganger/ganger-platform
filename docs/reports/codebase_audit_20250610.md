## üìä **AUDIT SCOPE & METHODOLOGY**

### **What Was Audited** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Complete codebase analysis**: All 6 apps, 6 packages, dependencies, configurations
- ‚úÖ **Documentation review**: Truth reconciliation between claims and verified reality
- ‚úÖ **Compilation testing**: Verified TypeScript compilation status across entire platform
- ‚úÖ **Service connectivity**: Live testing of MCP integrations and external services
- ‚úÖ **Quality gate verification**: Testing of automated verification systems
- ‚úÖ **Architecture validation**: Monorepo structure, package boundaries, shared components

### **Methodology**
- **Evidence-based verification** (all claims backed by actual command output)
- **Verification-first analysis** (run actual tests vs documentation claims)
- **Cross-reference validation** (comparing multiple documentation sources for consistency)
- **Terminal-based testing** (systematic compilation and build verification)
- **Anti-hallucination protocols** (preventing false claims about code status)
