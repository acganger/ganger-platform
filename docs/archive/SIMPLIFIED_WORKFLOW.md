# SIMPLIFIED PRACTICAL WORKFLOW

## ðŸš¨ **REALISTIC IMPLEMENTATION**

**Google Sheets ID**: `1AVWbNZg6ozBIVk0D-0EWaHk7xn3LxovGqzBKjgYGq8k`

## ðŸ”„ **HOW THIS ACTUALLY WORKS**

### **Terminal Prompting - SIMPLIFIED**

**Instead of complex commands, you simply paste this at the start of each terminal:**

#### **Terminal 1 (Frontend) - Copy/Paste This:**
```
You are working on Ganger Platform frontend. IMPORTANT CONTEXT:

1. Apps claimed "production ready" but have TypeScript compilation errors
2. Only EOS-L10 actually works - Inventory and Handouts apps fail compilation
3. Use Google Sheets (ID: 1AVWbNZg6ozBIVk0D-0EWaHk7xn3LxovGqzBKjgYGq8k) for task tracking
4. Before claiming anything is "complete" - run: npm run type-check && npm run build
5. Save progress to Memory MCP and Google Sheets as you work

Current reality: Fix compilation errors first, then build features.
Read: /mnt/q/Projects/ganger-platform/_claude_desktop/TERMINAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md for full context.
```

#### **Terminal 2 (Backend) - Copy/Paste This:**
```
You are working on Ganger Platform backend. IMPORTANT CONTEXT:

1. Package structure exists but has dependency issues (missing ioredis for Redis)
2. Apps have TypeScript errors preventing compilation
3. Use Google Sheets (ID: 1AVWbNZg6ozBIVk0D-0EWaHk7xn3LxovGqzBKjgYGq8k) for task tracking
4. Before claiming anything is "complete" - run: npm run type-check && npm run build
5. Save progress to Memory MCP and Google Sheets as you work

Current reality: Fix missing dependencies and compilation errors first.
Read: /mnt/q/Projects/ganger-platform/_claude_desktop/TERMINAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md for full context.
```

### **15-Minute Intervals - AUTOMATED**

**You DON'T manually intervene.** Instead:

1. **Terminals automatically save progress** to Memory MCP as they work
2. **Google Sheets gets updated** when terminals reach milestones
3. **You check progress** by refreshing the Google Sheet
4. **If context is lost**, terminal reads from Memory MCP + Google Sheets

### **Context Recovery - AUTOMATIC**

**If a terminal loses context:**
1. It automatically reads the 4 files in `/_claude_desktop/`
2. It loads the latest Memory MCP context
3. It checks Google Sheets for current assignment
4. It continues from the verified state

**You don't need to execute commands - the terminals do it.**

## ðŸ“Š **GOOGLE SHEETS STRUCTURE**

I'm going to create 4 sheets in your provided Google Sheet:

### **Sheet 1: Master Project Tracker**
- All PRDs broken into specific tasks
- Current status of each task
- Which terminal is assigned
- Verification status

### **Sheet 2: Daily Progress**
- What each terminal accomplished each day
- Current blockers
- Next day's planned work

### **Sheet 3: Compilation Status**
- Which apps/packages currently compile
- Which have errors
- Priority fixes needed

### **Sheet 4: Feature Verification**
- Features claimed vs actually working
- Verification test results
- Documentation accuracy

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **YOUR ROLE (SIMPLIFIED)**

### **What You Do:**
1. **Monitor Google Sheets** - See real progress without touching terminals
2. **Provide direction** - When terminals ask for priorities or decisions
3. **Check reality** - Periodically verify claims by testing actual features

### **What You DON'T Do:**
- Manual 15-minute interventions
- Execute recovery commands  
- Manage terminal coordination

### **What Terminals Do Automatically:**
- Save context to Memory MCP
- Update Google Sheets with progress
- Verify compilation before claiming completion
- Coordinate to avoid conflicts

## ðŸš€ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

1. **I'll set up the Google Sheets structure** using your provided ID
2. **I'll populate it with current reality** (what actually works vs claims)
3. **I'll create simple terminal startup prompts** you can copy/paste
4. **Terminals will begin systematic fixes** starting with compilation errors
