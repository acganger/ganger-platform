# Production Test Report - Ganger Platform

**Date**: January 7, 2025  
**Test Type**: Full Production-Like Testing with Vercel CLI

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented Vercel testing infrastructure across the entire monorepo with remote caching capabilities. While dependency installation timeouts prevented full production builds during testing, the infrastructure is properly configured and ready for use.

## Test Results

### 1. Vercel CLI Setup ✅
- **Status**: Complete
- Installed Vercel CLI v43.3.0 globally
- Configured authentication with VERCEL_TOKEN
- Created `.env.local` from production `.env`

### 2. App Linking ✅
- **Status**: Complete
- All 22 apps successfully linked to Vercel projects
- Each app has `.vercel/project.json` configuration
- Project settings synchronized with `vercel pull`

### 3. Turbo Remote Caching ✅
- **Status**: Complete
- Configured in `turbo.json` with team ID
- Created `.turbo/config.json` with credentials
- Cache status verification working

### 4. Production Build Testing ⚠️
- **Status**: Partial
- Issue: Dependency installation timeouts (>3-5 minutes)
- Some apps have broken next.js symlinks
- Turbo dry run shows proper task graph

### 5. Infrastructure Scripts ✅
- **Status**: Complete
- Created 4 utility scripts:
  - `link-all-apps-to-vercel.sh`
  - `vercel-build-all.sh`
  - `setup-turbo-remote-cache.sh`
  - `vercel-monorepo-test.sh`

## Key Findings

### Successes
1. **Vercel Integration**: All apps properly linked to Vercel projects
2. **Remote Caching**: Turbo configured for shared cache across team
3. **Scripts**: Comprehensive testing utilities created
4. **Documentation**: Updated CLAUDE.md with Vercel testing section

### Issues Encountered
1. **Dependency Installation**: pnpm install taking >3 minutes, causing timeouts
2. **Next.js Symlinks**: Some apps have broken symlinks to next binary
3. **Vercel Build**: Requires full reinstall of dependencies each time

### Turbo Cache Analysis
```
Remote Cache: Configured (team_wpY7PcIsYQNnslNN39o7fWvS)
Cache Hits: 0 (no previous builds cached)
Tasks Graph: Properly configured with all dependencies
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile=false` with extended timeout
2. Fix broken next.js symlinks in affected apps
3. Test individual apps with working dependencies first

### Performance Optimization
1. Use standard `pnpm build` for faster local builds
2. Use `vercel build` only for production verification
3. Leverage Turbo cache for incremental builds

### Best Practices
1. Always run `vercel pull` before testing
2. Use `--dry` flag to preview build tasks
3. Monitor cache hit rates for optimization

## Testing Commands

### Quick Tests
```bash
# Test single app build
./scripts/vercel-monorepo-test.sh build inventory

# Test dev server
./scripts/vercel-monorepo-test.sh dev inventory

# Check cache status
./scripts/vercel-monorepo-test.sh cache-status
```

### Full Tests
```bash
# Link all apps
./scripts/link-all-apps-to-vercel.sh

# Build all apps
./scripts/vercel-build-all.sh

# Standard monorepo build (faster)
pnpm run build
```

## Environment Configuration

### Required Variables
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Authentication token (stored in .env)
- `VERCEL_TEAM_ID`: Team identifier (stored in .env)
- All production environment variables in `.env.local`

### Vercel Project Settings
- Build Command: `npx turbo run build --filter=@ganger/[app-name]`
- Install Command: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile=false`
- Output Directory: `.next`
- Node Version: 22.x

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Dependencies**: Resolve installation timeout issues
2. **Test Individual Apps**: Start with apps that have working dependencies
3. **Production Deploy**: Use `vercel --prod` after successful local tests
4. **Monitor Cache**: Track cache hit rates for optimization

## Conclusion

The Vercel testing infrastructure is successfully implemented and configured. While dependency installation issues prevent immediate full testing, the foundation is solid for production-like testing across the monorepo. The remote caching setup will significantly improve build times once builds start populating the cache.

### Test Status Summary
- ✅ Infrastructure Setup: Complete
- ✅ App Linking: Complete
- ✅ Remote Caching: Configured
- ⚠️ Full Build Test: Pending (dependency issues)
- ✅ Documentation: Complete

The platform is ready for production testing once dependency issues are resolved.
