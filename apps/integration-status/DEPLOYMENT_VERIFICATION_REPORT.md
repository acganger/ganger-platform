- **CI/CD Pipeline**: ✅ GitHub Actions working with pnpm
- **DNS Management**: ✅ Cloudflare zone active

### 🔧 **DEPLOYMENT PATTERNS**

#### Pattern 1: Simple Workers (medication-auth model)
```toml
name = "ganger-app-name"
main = "worker-simple.js"
compatibility_date = "2024-06-12"
[env.production]
routes = [{ pattern = "subdomain.gangerdermatology.com/*", zone_name = "gangerdermatology.com" }]
```

#### Pattern 2: Workers + R2 (integration-status model)
```toml
name = "ganger-app-name"  
main = "worker.js"
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "ASSETS"
```

#### Pattern 3: API-Only Workers (platform-dashboard model)
```toml
name = "ganger-app-name"
main = "worker.js"
# No R2 bucket, pure API service
```
