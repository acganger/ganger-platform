## üö® Critical Issues to Fix Before Deployment

### 1. API Route Pattern Violations ‚ùå

**Issue**: Same pattern violations as AI Purchasing Agent

**Files to Fix**:
- [ ] `/app/api/products/route.ts` - Repository creation at module level
- [ ] `/app/api/orders/route.ts` - Repository creation at module level
- [ ] `/app/api/orders/[id]/route.ts` - Repository creation at module level

### 2. Missing Critical Functionality ‚ùå

**Missing Features**:
- [ ] Cart functionality (referenced but not implemented)
- [ ] Product search and filtering
- [ ] Order submission workflow
- [ ] Department-based product filtering
- [ ] Bulk order templates

### 3. Type Mismatches ‚ùå

**Issues Found**:
- ConsolidatedOrder missing `total_estimated_cost` field
- Urgency level mapping (emergency ‚Üí urgent)
- Product category type handling

## üîß Required Implementations

### 1. Complete Order Workflow

```typescript
// Missing pages to create:
- app/cart/page.tsx - Shopping cart with bulk edit
- app/review/page.tsx - Order review before submission
- app/history/page.tsx - Past order history
- app/templates/page.tsx - Saved order templates
```

### 2. Implement Product Catalog Integration

```typescript
// ProductCatalog component exists but not used
- Integrate into main page
- Add department filtering
- Implement search functionality
- Add to cart functionality
```

### 3. Fix Order Submission Flow

```typescript
// Current flow is incomplete
- Add validation before submission
- Implement approval workflow
- Add email notifications
- Create order confirmation page
```

## üéØ Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Checklist

For the app to be minimally functional:
- [ ] Users can browse products
- [ ] Users can add items to cart
- [ ] Users can submit orders
- [ ] Orders are saved to database
- [ ] Basic authentication works
- [ ] Deployment successful

Current MVP Status: **NOT MET** - Missing cart and order submission

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Focus on MVP First**: Get basic ordering working before advanced features
2. **Reuse AI Agent Components**: Many components can be shared
3. **Simplify Initial Version**: Remove complex features for v1
4. **Test with Real Users**: Get feedback early and often

The foundation is solid, but significant work remains to make this production-ready.
