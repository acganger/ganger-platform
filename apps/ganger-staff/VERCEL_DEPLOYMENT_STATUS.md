## ‚ùå Manual Steps Required in Vercel Dashboard

1. **Fix GitHub Repository Connection**:
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/ganger/ganger-staff/settings/git
   - Disconnect the current repository (wrong repo connected)
   - Connect to: `acganger/ganger-platform`
   - Root directory: `apps/ganger-staff`

2. **Trigger Deployment**:
   - Once GitHub is connected, push will auto-deploy
   - Or manually trigger from Vercel dashboard

## üîç Current Issue

The project is currently connected to the wrong GitHub repository. The Vercel GitHub integration needs access to the `acganger/ganger-platform` repository and must be manually connected through the dashboard.

## üìù Verification Steps

Once deployed:
1. Visit the deployment URL
2. Check middleware routing works
3. Test `/inventory` routes to the inventory app
4. Verify Edge Config is reading app URLs
