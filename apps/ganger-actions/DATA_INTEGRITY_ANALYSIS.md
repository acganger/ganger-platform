# Ganger Actions - Data Integrity Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the data collection, storage, and reporting capabilities of the Ganger Actions ticketing system. The analysis simulates the complete workflow from employee submission through database storage to supervisor reporting.

**Key Finding**: The system has good foundational architecture but **critical data fields are missing** that would significantly impact reporting effectiveness.

## 1. Form Analysis - Employee Perspective

### 1.1 Support Ticket Form
**Data Collected:**
- ✅ Location (Wixom/Ann Arbor/Plymouth)
- ✅ Request Type (General Support/Equipment Issue/Software Problem/Network Issue/Other)
- ✅ Priority (low/medium/high/urgent)
- ✅ Details (2000 char max)
- ✅ Submitter Name & Email
- ✅ File Attachments (up to 10 files, 50MB total)

**Missing Fields:**
- ❌ Department/Team identification
- ❌ Affected systems/equipment specifics
- ❌ Business impact assessment

### 1.3 Punch Fix Form
**Data Collected:**
- ⚠️ Date of issue
- ⚠️ In/Out times (but schema mismatch - see issues)
- ⚠️ Comments/Reason
- ❌ Location NOT captured

**Schema Issues Found:**
- Form collects `in_time`/`out_time` but also has fields for `scheduled_in`/`scheduled_out`/`actual_in`/`actual_out`
- Form uses `comments` but schema expects `reason`
- No location field despite being required for all tickets

### 1.4 Expense Reimbursement Form
**Data Collected:**
- ✅ Expense Type & Category
- ✅ Multiple expense items with date/category/description/amount
- ✅ Total calculation
- ✅ Business purpose
- ✅ Receipt uploads
- ✅ Submitter info

**Missing Fields:**
- ❌ Location not captured
- ❌ Project/client association
- ❌ Manager approval required flag
- ❌ Payment method preference

### 1.5 Meeting Request Form
**Data Collected:**
- ✅ Meeting type and title
- ✅ Purpose/description
- ✅ Multiple date/time preferences
- ✅ Participants list
- ✅ Submitter info

**Missing Fields:**
- ❌ Location not captured
- ❌ Meeting location preference (in-person/virtual)
- ❌ Required resources (room, equipment)
- ❌ Recurring meeting options

### 1.6 Impact Filter Form
**Data Collected:**
- ✅ Goal/decision description

- ✅ Success definition
- ✅ Tradeoffs identification
- ✅ Participants/stakeholders
- ✅ Timeframe

**Missing Fields:**
- ❌ Location not captured

## 2. Database Schema Analysis

### 2.1 Tickets Table Structure
```sql
-- Core fields properly defined:
- id, ticket_number (auto-generated YY-NNNNNN format)
- form_type (7 types supported)
- submitter info (email, name, id)
- status workflow (9 statuses)
- priority levels
- location (nullable - problematic!)
- assignment tracking
- timestamps for workflow
- form_data JSONB (flexible storage)
```

### 2.2 Critical Schema Issues

1. **Location Field is Nullable**
   - Database allows NULL location
   - Forms don't consistently capture location
   - Reporting by location will have gaps

2. **No Department Field**
   - Cannot report by department
   - No organizational hierarchy
   - Cross-department metrics impossible

3. **Limited Categorization**
   - Only has generic 'category' field
   - No sub-categorization
   - No tagging system

4. **Missing Calculated Fields**
   - No resolution time calculation
   - No business hours tracking
   - No SLA tracking

### 2.3 JSONB Storage Analysis
The `form_data` JSONB field stores form-specific data, which provides flexibility but creates challenges:

**Pros:**
- Flexible schema per form type
- Can add fields without migrations
- Preserves all form data

**Cons:**
- Inconsistent field naming
- No validation at DB level
- Complex querying for reports
- No indexes on JSONB fields

## 3. Reporting Capabilities Assessment

### 3.1 Current Reporting Views
```sql
-- ticket_stats view provides:
- Open tickets count
- Pending approval count
- In progress count
- Completed last 30 days
- Created last 7 days
- Average resolution hours

-- user_ticket_summary provides:
- Per-user ticket counts
- Status breakdowns
- Priority counts
```

### 3.2 Missing Reporting Capabilities

1. **Location-Based Reports**
   - Cannot reliably filter by location
   - Missing location data in many tickets
   - No location performance comparison

2. **Department Analytics**
   - No department field to group by
   - Cannot measure department workload
   - No inter-department request tracking

3. **Time-Based Analysis**
   - No business hours calculation
   - No SLA compliance tracking
   - Limited trend analysis

4. **Form-Specific Reports**
   - JSONB queries not optimized
   - No indexes on common fields
   - Difficult to aggregate form data

5. **Manager Dashboard Gaps**
   - No team view capabilities
   - Limited approval workflow visibility
   - No delegation tracking

## 4. Data Integrity Issues Summary

### 4.1 Critical Issues
1. **Location data inconsistency** - Not captured in 5 of 7 forms
2. **No department tracking** - Major reporting limitation
3. **Schema mismatches** - Form fields don't match database/type definitions
4. **Missing audit trail** - No change history tracking

### 4.2 Moderate Issues
1. **Inconsistent field naming** - 'comments' vs 'reason' vs 'details'
2. **No data validation** - JSONB allows any structure
3. **Limited search capability** - Only title/description indexed
4. **No file upload tracking** - Files referenced but not in schema

### 4.3 Minor Issues
1. **No field-level permissions** - All or nothing access
2. **Limited notification preferences** - Basic email only
3. **No template system** - Repeated data entry
4. **No draft/autosave** - Risk of data loss

## 5. Recommendations

### 5.1 Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Add location field to ALL forms** - Standardize on required location
2. **Add department field** to tickets table and all forms
3. **Fix schema mismatches** in punch fix form
4. **Create validation layer** for JSONB data

### 5.2 Short-term Improvements (Medium Priority)
1. **Add reporting indexes** on JSONB common fields
2. **Create department hierarchy table**
3. **Implement audit log table** for changes
4. **Add calculated fields** for metrics

### 5.3 Long-term Enhancements (Low Priority)
1. **Implement tagging system** for better categorization
2. **Add workflow automation** rules
3. **Create custom field system** for forms
4. **Build reporting API** with aggregations

## 6. SQL Migration Scripts Needed

```sql
-- 1. Make location required
ALTER TABLE tickets ALTER COLUMN location SET NOT NULL;

-- 2. Add department field
ALTER TABLE tickets ADD COLUMN department TEXT;
ALTER TABLE tickets ADD COLUMN submitter_department TEXT;

-- 3. Add calculated fields
ALTER TABLE tickets ADD COLUMN resolution_hours INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE tickets ADD COLUMN business_hours INTEGER;

-- 4. Add indexes for reporting
CREATE INDEX idx_tickets_form_data_location ON tickets((form_data->>'location'));
CREATE INDEX idx_tickets_form_data_department ON tickets((form_data->>'department'));

-- 5. Create audit log table
CREATE TABLE ticket_audit_log (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  ticket_id UUID REFERENCES tickets(id),
  changed_by TEXT,
  changed_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  field_name TEXT,
  old_value TEXT,
  new_value TEXT
);
```

## 7. Conclusion

The Ganger Actions platform has a solid foundation but needs critical improvements for effective reporting:

1. **Data Completeness**: Location and department must be captured consistently
2. **Schema Alignment**: Forms must match database expectations
3. **Reporting Infrastructure**: Indexes and views need optimization
4. **Data Quality**: Validation and standardization required

Implementing these changes will transform the system from a basic ticketing tool to a comprehensive workforce management platform with robust analytics capabilities.
